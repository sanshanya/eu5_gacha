  gacha_raiden_origin_trait: "Narukami Island: Eternal Stillness"
  desc_gacha_raiden_origin_trait: "So-called 'rebellion' is nothing more than noise. As long as my radiance shines bright enough, shadows will have nowhere to hide. I shall make your nation as calm as a motionless lake. Quietude is the precondition for 'eternity'."

  gacha_raiden_awakened_trait: "Secret Art: Musou no Hitotachi"
  desc_gacha_raiden_awakened_trait: "This blade once felled gods. To use it now to open new lands for you is hardly a disgrace. No need for tactics, no need for schemes—once my lightning flashes, the enemy ranks are already ash."

  gacha_raiden_transcended_trait: "Supreme Authority Over All"
  desc_gacha_raiden_transcended_trait: "Authority is not to be divided, and my will is not to be defied. Since I have been seated here, I will not permit any 'council' or 'estate' to prattle. This body is the absolute. This body is the law."

  gacha_raiden_c4_trait: "Dreams: True Edict"
  desc_gacha_raiden_c4_trait: "Watching the warriors charge... I am reminded of Sasayuri and Chiyo from days long past. No—this Shogun will not grow sentimental. I shall grant the whole army the blessing of 'Musou Isshin'. So long as they offer me their loyalty, I promise them one thing—victory."

  gacha_raiden_c6_trait: "Source of Wishes"
  desc_gacha_raiden_c6_trait: "Once, I believed 'eternity' to be time forever frozen. Yet watching you build this vast empire step by step, I have begun to glimpse another possibility. Since mortal wishes can shine so brilliantly, then I shall try—just this once—to gaze upon the future you carve out."

  gacha_raiden_events.1.desc: "I am the Raiden Shogun.\n\nSince you have awakened my consciousness, you must already be prepared to bear 'eternity' upon your shoulders.\n\nThere is no need to be nervous. I have already examined these lands.\n\nWar is frequent, laws are slack, and the hearts of the people waver like disordered thunder.\n\nYet amidst the chaos there is also a certain... resilience that stirs old memories.\n\nNow that I have descended, there shall be no more meaningless sacrifice here.\n\nI will bring Inazuma's laws to this realm.\n\nIf you cannot keep pace with me, or if you are swallowed by 'erosion'...\n\nthen I will cut you down without hesitation.\n\nDo not disappoint me."

  gacha_raiden_events.4.title: "Walking Beside Your Eternity"
  gacha_raiden_events.4.desc: "I am Ei.\n\nFor long years, I sealed myself away within the Plane of Euthymia, leaving the 'Shogun' to carry out eternity's decrees.\n\nI had witnessed too many losses, and so I sought to hold time still.\n\nI had seen too much erosion, and so I wished to freeze all desire.\n\nWhen I first arrived here, I thought this would be yet another mortal nation fated for destruction.\n\nI was prepared to cut down every 'variable', just as I once did in Inazuma.\n\nBut... you are different.\n\nYou protect the weak amid the flames of war; you preserve sincerity amidst schemes and intrigue.\n\nYou have shown me that even mortals, fleeting as morning dew, can blaze with light brighter than the stars.\n\nThe 'Shogun' will remain your blade, cleaving apart all who stand against you.\n\nAs for me...\n\nI will sheath the thunder and brew you a pot of tea.\n\nYou need not fear erosion, nor the end.\n\nSo long as you keep moving forward, I shall, with this body, make you a promise—\n\nyour realm shall be eternity."

  # === C3 Event: Night of Thunder, 'Logistics Inspection' ===
  gacha_raiden_c3_title: "Thunderstorm Night: 'Logistics Inspection'"

  # Scene 1: Divine Awe
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_1_desc: "Purple arcs of lightning crawl across the outer wall of the imperial study, and the air is thick with ozone. Attendants keep well away; only you push open the heavy doors against the static. This thunderstorm is no natural calamity—it is overflowing pressure from a higher will."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Enter the study: pay audience to the exalted one."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"

  # Scene 2: Time at Rest
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_2_desc: "The Shogun floats half a foot above the floor, lightning coiling around her as she faces the rainy night.\n\nHer voice resounds directly in your mind:\n\n'The Electro of this world... is disordered and weak. Not only is it without structure; it is feeble.'\n\nThe desk is piled with war manuals, ledgers, and memorials that have been pushed aside."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Bow your head: ask what decree brings the Shogun here at this hour."

  # Scene 3: Erosion of Eternity
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_3_desc: "She slowly turns and gestures lightly toward that heap of papers.\n\n'I have reviewed the so-called diversions you have presented. Histories, military treatises, philosophy... nothing but worn-out clichés. Stare at this stagnant water long enough, and even I will be corroded by something called boredom.'\n\n'Mortal sovereign, does your realm truly have nothing at all that can be considered a variable worthy of note?'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Ponder: a 'variable'..."

  # Scene 4: A Game of Offerings (Route Lock)
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_4_desc: "Before a god's questioning, ordinary tribute is meaningless. You order the attendants to bring forth a special offering, then wait until they have withdrawn before sliding it before Ei."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Present a novel: 'A popular foreign tale, absurd on the surface, yet recording mortals' boldest flights of fancy.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Present a dessert: 'A sweet the imperial kitchens have tested a thousand times over, all for a single instant of satisfaction.'"

  # Scene 5: Scrutiny
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Ei lazily reads out the overlong title: 'So, Even in Another World, I Must Become a Grand Duke? Presumptuous.'\n\nShe flips open the first page; her gaze gradually sharpens. 'The protagonist abandons divine protection and uses mortal hands to overturn causality? Arrogant... but an interesting sample to observe.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "She studies the syrup-glazed dango. 'Milk blended with glutinous rice? Its appearance may be inferior to Inazuman confections, but this aura is unlike standard field rations.'\n\nWith elegant yet unhesitating motions, she picks up a skewer."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "Thunder crashes outside, yet she does not so much as blink; all her attention is fixed on the novelty in her hands."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Stand quietly at her side."

  # Scene 6: Stillness
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_desc_a: "She sits; the lightning field around her recedes. Cradling the book, her brows knit and smooth in turn, as if she were reviewing an important war report.\n\n'...Acceptable. This trace of novelty makes time feel slightly more real.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_desc_b: "She sits; the lightning field around her recedes. Taking small bites of the dango, she looks utterly focused, as though performing a delicate elemental refinement.\n\n'...Acceptable. This trace of novelty makes time feel slightly more real.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_desc_common: "\n\nShe sits down; the field of lightning withdraws."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Wait."

  # Scene 7: Judgment
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "'The prose is crude, and its logic riddled with holes—but the will to break fate is not entirely without merit. Mortal fantasies do, on occasion, brush against the edge of truth.'\n\n'From now on, send me any such works that record otherworldly variables directly. You have my leave to submit them.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "'Soft texture, moderate sweetness—calms fluctuations of the mind and aids in stabilizing meditation. As military supplies, it is acceptable.'\n\n'If there are any materials that assist with mental composure, you need not wait for my review—only you are permitted to present them.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Bow deeply: 'As you command.'"

  # Scene 8: The Rain Stops
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_8_desc: "Outside, the rain has stopped, and moonlight spills across lacquered armor. She smooths her sleeves; the softness belonging to Ei recedes, and the Shogun takes over.\n\n'Rest is over. Tedium has been alleviated. Let all return to their posts.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Step back: respectfully see the Shogun off."

  # Scene 9: Endings
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Ei still holds the novel in her hand.\n\n'This book will be requisitioned for now. As for the protagonist's choice in chapter five—after morning court tomorrow, you may come to the study. I have several objections and wish to debate them with you.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "As you wish, Shogun."

  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "At the doorway, Ei glances sideways at the empty food box on the table.\n\n'As for that type of dango from earlier—if glutinous rice and milk could be fully fused into a drinkable liquid, intake efficiency would likely improve. This is a top-priority directive for logistical improvement.'"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Reverently accept the divine decree."
