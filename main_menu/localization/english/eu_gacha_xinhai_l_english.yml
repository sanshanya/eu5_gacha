  # === Traits ===
  gacha_xinhai_origin_trait: "Coral Lanterns of Watatsumi"
  desc_gacha_xinhai_origin_trait: "“Your homeland is sick... just like the time the sacred soil turned pale. Whenever the coral lanterns of Bourou Village are lit, I always feel as if everything will be all right in the end.\n\nPerhaps... I can bring that feeling here as well.”"

  gacha_xinhai_awakened_trait: "Young Tactician of Bourou Village"
  desc_gacha_xinhai_awakened_trait: "“Running through battle manuals in the sea breeze of Bourou Village, it always feels as if the waves would wash the enemy away for me...\n\nBut your battlefield is much larger than I imagined. I’ll try my hand at the divinations this once— it’s just that, once the war is over, I’d very much like to go back to sleep.”"

  gacha_xinhai_transcended_trait: "Seat of the Divine Priestess"
  desc_gacha_xinhai_transcended_trait: "“You’ve asked me to sit in such a prominent place, but I’m not used to being worshiped by all.\n\nRather than ‘rule’ in the strict sense, I’d rather be like during the old rites back on Watatsumi—bringing peace to people’s hearts.\n\nWhen hearts are calm, the sparks of rebellion die out on their own.”"

  # Constellation Traits
  gacha_xinhai_c2_trait: "Byakuyakoku · Sacred Tides"
  desc_gacha_xinhai_c2_trait: "“Do you hear it? That is the tide surging beneath the sacred soil.\n\nI’ve woven Watatsumi’s rites into this land. Plagues will be washed clean by the sea, and ruins will be reborn on the tides.\n\nSo long as that sound does not cease, the hearts of every estate will not dry out.\n\nRest easy—this land is breathing.”"

  gacha_xinhai_c4_trait: "Enkanomiya · Dragon-Hunt Tactics"
  desc_gacha_xinhai_c4_trait: "“I dreamed again of Enkanomiya’s lights... reflected on the water’s surface, as if they had grown scales.\n\nWhen your fleet formed up its battle line at sea, I suddenly knew exactly what needed to be done. The way of strategy is to calculate in the temple before the storm ever breaks... though I must admit, I am a little tired.”\n\n“I have dreamt of the deep-sea drakes on the hunt—the suffocating pressure of something vast swimming through the dark.\n\nNow, I’ve given that same tactic to your fleet. They will be as swift as ghosts and as steadfast as reefs.\n\nOn this ocean, no wind or wave will wear down your resolve—because the helm is in my hands.”"

  gacha_xinhai_c6_trait: "Orobashi · Incarnate God"
  desc_gacha_xinhai_c6_trait: "“Once, I saw the seat of the ‘Divine Priestess’ as a burden I had no choice but to bear.\n\nBut now... watching your back as you walk ahead, I’ve come to understand what ‘rule’ truly means.\n\nDo not fear rebellion or exhaustion. I will guard this peace for ages to come with absolute discipline and quiet gentleness—just as Orobashi once watched over Watatsumi Island.”"

  gacha_xinhai_events.1.title: "Divine Priestess Sangonomiya Kokomi — Temporary Strategic Advisor"
  gacha_xinhai_events.1.desc: "“I am Sangonomiya Kokomi. Though I had a feeling something like this might happen, being summoned directly here is still a surprise.\n\nI glanced over your map of the realm earlier. Your supply lines are a hundred times more complex than those of Watatsumi Island, and great powers entangle themselves in endless diplomacy. These administrative documents are piled like mountains—my energy is nearly spent just looking at them.\n\nIf you resorted to a summoning ritual, you must be facing a deadlock. As a strategist, I can’t simply sit by and watch a war descend into chaos. I’ll try to simulate the situation for you.\n\nBut please remember: once the victory is secured, you must allow me to retreat to my room and rest.”"
  gacha_xinhai_events.1.a: "We welcome our strategist to court."

  gacha_xinhai_events.2.title: "Stratagems in a Silk Pouch"
  gacha_xinhai_events.2.desc: "As the power of your wishes deepens, Sangonomiya Kokomi feels a familiar strength returning.\n\nHer grasp of the art of war grows keener, as if she can already see every variable on the battlefield.\n\n$gacha_text_reward_prestige_small$"
  gacha_xinhai_events.2.a: "Win a thousand miles away with a thought."

  gacha_xinhai_events.4.title: "One Heart in Orobashi’s Stead"
  gacha_xinhai_events.4.desc: "“I am Sangonomiya Kokomi.\n\nBack on Watatsumi Island, I always hid away in Enkanomiya to study the art of war. As long as I had calculated every variable, I could protect everyone and maintain a fragile peace.\n\nThe day you summoned me here and set me before an empire a hundred times larger than Inazuma, I was honestly afraid. Afraid my divinations would be wrong. Afraid of unfamiliar gazes. Afraid of failing the expectations placed upon me.\n\nBut you never rushed me, and you never doubted me. You kept me company as we looked at the moon over the map table at night, and you had a chair added for me in your council chamber.\n\nAt some point, I stopped thinking, ‘Once this battle is over, I’ll finally get to go back to sleep.’\n\nI’ve watched the sun rise and set across this continent. Your fleets have learned to breathe like the shoals around Watatsumi. Flowers bloom across your lands and do not wither.\n\n...Thank you. Thank you for walking this far with me.\n\nWould you... take a few more walks with me? The sea has always brought me different moods.\n\nAnd now...\nWhen I look at your back, I feel as if I were looking at the ocean.\nBecause that sea is already within your realm— and within my heart as well.”\n\n$gacha_text_reward_prestige_medium$\n$gacha_text_reward_legitimacy_medium$"
  gacha_xinhai_events.4.a: "Surely, this is Heaven’s favor!"

  gacha_xinhai_events.11.title: "First Murmur of Sacred Tides"
  gacha_xinhai_events.11.desc: "“Your land is starting to bleach... It’s even worse than the sacred soil was. I’ve seen such scenes before on Watatsumi Island.\n\nThe sea has always brought me different feelings—but this time, I’ll have to think of another way. I can’t let this place become a desert as well.”\n\n$gacha_text_reward_stability_small$"
  gacha_xinhai_events.11.a: "Her loyalty is beyond price."

  gacha_xinhai_events.12.title: "Dragon King of the Deep Awakens"
  gacha_xinhai_events.12.desc: "“I dreamed once more of Enkanomiya’s lights... reflected on the water, as if they’d grown scales. When your fleet deployed at sea, I suddenly knew exactly what to do.\n\nThe art of war is to calculate in the temple before the storm ever breaks... It’s just that I’m a little tired now.”\n\n$gacha_text_reward_legitimacy_small$"
  gacha_xinhai_events.12.a: "The sea will be our sharpest blade!"

  gacha_xinhai_events.13.title: "An Unexpected Extra Seat"
  gacha_xinhai_events.13.desc: "“I didn’t expect my simulations to create an extra seat in your cabinet.\n\nThank you for walking with me for so long—time like that is both precious and rare. When the evening wind blows from Bourou Village, I can’t help but think... with one more person to discuss things with, perhaps fewer people will need to die in war.”"
  gacha_xinhai_events.13.a: "Then let’s add one more chair."

  gacha_xinhai_events.14.title: "An Unexpected Policy Slot"
  gacha_xinhai_events.14.desc: "“I didn’t expect there to be room for one more national policy...\n\nI’m not very good at dealing with so many eyes on me. I did say I was just a strategist...\n\nBut the weak have to stand together if they’re to resist, don’t they?\n\nSince I’m here, I’ll walk a little further with you.”"
  gacha_xinhai_events.14.a: "Then let’s think one step further."

  # === C3 Affection Event (V3) ===
  gacha_xinhai_c3_title: "Tactical Retreat in the Moonlight"

  # Scene 1
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_1_desc: "#ZG The candle flame on the pile of documents flickers once, then finally dies in the dried wax.\nThe arguments over tax adjustments and frontier supplies have at last fallen silent as the ink dries. You rub at your throbbing temples and push open the heavy door leading out to the terrace.\nThe night wind, cool with dew, rushes against your face. Yet at the heart of this vast empire, it is hard to fully relax, even at this hour. The wind howling through high walls and corridors sounds like the whispering of countless petitions still awaiting your seal.#!\nYou need a brief escape.\nGo and get some air."
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Step out onto the terrace."
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_1_opt_b: "go straight to bed tonight.#ZG 『Skip the scene』#!"

  # Scene 2
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_2_desc: "#ZG A corner that is usually deserted has, tonight, been occupied.#!\nIt is #bold;color_yellow Sangonomiya Kokomi#!.\n#ZG She has not noticed your arrival at all. The ‘Divine Priestess’ who commands the armies with flawless plans by day is now draped bonelessly over the cold stone railing, like a shell left behind on the shore after the tide retreats.#!\nOne hand traces lazy shapes in the air, her fingertips drawing a slow arc in the moonlight, as if sketching the trail of fish swimming through the deep.\n#ZG It is a side of her you have never seen before—unguarded, with a hint of daze about it...#!"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Tread lightly."

  # Scene 3
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_3_desc: "#ZG Even with your steps carefully measured, the crunch of your boots on fallen leaves cuts through the silence.#!\n#ZG Kokomi’s shoulders flinch. She turns around at once, hands crossing over her chest and freezing there in the moonlight.#!\n#ZG The surprise in her eyes vanishes in an instant, but the tiny movement of her throat betrays her mood.#!\n#ZG And of course, there is the faint dusting of white crumbs at the corner of her lips that she has not yet had time to wipe away.#!\nKokomi: “...Your Majesty? S–So late at night... are you inspecting the security of the central palace?”\n#ZG Her tone is steady, but her gaze wanders. Her fingers tighten unconsciously on her collar as she tries to block your stare with an innocent expression.#!\nKokomi: “I’ve already gone over the rotation schedules for the garrison in my head... There are no oversights.”"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Stop where you are."

  # Scene 4
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_4_desc: "#ZG Her ‘strategist’ mind is working at full speed, trying to construct a plausible explanation for how she just looked.#!\n#ZG But this defensive line meant to protect the dignity of the ‘Divine Priestess’ is thin and unnecessary.#!\nFacing her stiff, fragile facade, you decide:"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "No need to be nervous. I only came out here for some air too."
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "We can discuss security tomorrow. For now, you’ve still got pastry crumbs at the corner of your mouth."

  # Scene 5
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "#ZG At your words, her movements pause. The rigid line of her back relaxes, and she lets out a faint sigh. The ‘strategist aura’ she had been trying to gather disperses, leaving only the quiet girl you see in everyday life.#!\n"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "#ZG She freezes for a heartbeat, then turns away in a fluster to wipe her lips. When she faces you again, a blush has already bloomed across her cheeks. She gives a helpless little smile, and most of the stiffness in her gaze melts away.#!\n"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "#ZG Moonlight traces the gentle curve of her neck.#!\nKokomi: “...I’ve made a bit of a fool of myself. I didn’t mean to slack off.”\nShe tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her gaze dropping toward the floor.\nKokomi: “It’s just that the logic this world runs on is far more complex than that of Watatsumi. Broad lands, clashing faiths, and administrative resources that are constantly on the brink of deficit...”\n#ZG She’s completely worn out.#!"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Listen quietly."

  # Scene 6
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_6_desc: "#ZG Kokomi turns to face the night sky beyond the railing, her eyes unfocused as they drift into the dark, her expression tinged with loneliness.#!\nKokomi: “Keeping up the appearance of ‘never miscalculating’ costs much more than I expected.”\n#ZG She extends a hand, palm upwards, as if she wishes to catch the moonlight—yet in the end, she grasps nothing at all.#!\nKokomi: “On Watatsumi Island, when my energy ran dry, I would dive into a seafloor cavern where no one could ever find me. The weight of the water and the darkness there made me feel safe.”\nKokomi: “But this foreign palace... it’s grand, yet open on all sides. The cold stone walls cannot shut out gazes and whispers. It’s a huge place—and somehow, there isn’t a single ‘dead angle’ where I can safely recharge.”\n#ZG So that’s why she came here at this hour.#!"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Walk up to stand beside her."

  # Scene 7
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_7_desc: "#ZG The wind brushes at your clothes, the faint rasp of fabric whispering in the stillness.#!\n#ZG Watching her slightly frail figure, you realize that what this burdened strategist needs is not just rest, but the rare privilege of being allowed to ‘be weak’ for a while.#!\nYou step forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with her. The moon stretches your shadows long, overlapping across the cold stone floor.\nIn this court full of schemes and stares, you decide:"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "If you’re tired, come here from now on. I’ll declare this terrace a ‘top secret’ area."
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_7_opt_b: "Honestly, I often want to run away too. Next time you feel like hiding... take me with you."

  # Scene 8
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_8_desc: "#ZG At your words, she blinks in surprise. The last trace of wariness fades from her eyes, and her expression finally relaxes.#!\nKokomi: “...What a strange kind of royal decree, Your Majesty.”\n#ZG Her tone might say that, but her voice is much lighter than before.#!\nKokomi: “Still... whether it’s a corner placed under seal, or having an extra partner in retreat... both sound rather nice.”\n#ZG She closes her eyes and takes in a deep breath of the cool night air, as if surfacing from the lightless depths.#!\nKokomi: “It’s strange. After just a few words with you, it feels like the energy I’d spent has... mostly come back already.”\n#ZG You smile as you watch her.#!"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "I’m glad to hear it."

  # Scene 9
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "#ZG Kokomi steps back half a pace, lifts the hem of her dress, and offers you a courtly bow of flawless form.#!\nKokomi: “Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty. In a foreign world like this, having a place where I can lower my guard is truly precious.”\n#ZG She straightens her clothes again; her gaze has turned clear and resolute.#!\nKokomi: “Then, as thanks, I’ll present a perfect plan at tomorrow’s strategy meeting. I won’t let you down.”\n#ZG\n#ZG ...#!\n#ZG She turns and leaves the terrace, her steps light and composed.#!\n#ZG What a confident young lady.#!"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "#ZG Kokomi raises a finger to her lips in a ‘shh’ gesture, blinking at you with a playful, conspiratorial look only a girl her age could pull off.#!\nKokomi: “So we have an agreement, then? This will be our own... ‘tactical retreat.’ Just for the two of us.”\n#ZG She lowers her voice, leaning in to whisper by your ear.#!\nKokomi: “If you ever grow tired of long sessions of state business, just give the signal. As your strategist, I’ll arrange the perfect ‘disappearance plan’ for you—no one will be able to find us.”\n#ZG ...#!\n#ZG She leaves the terrace with a soft laugh, slipping into the night like a nimble fish.#!\n"
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Good night, Kokomi."
  gacha_xinhai_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "It’s a promise."
