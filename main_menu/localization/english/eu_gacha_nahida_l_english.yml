  # === Traits ===
  gacha_nahida_origin_trait: "Caged Bird of the Sanctuary"
  desc_gacha_nahida_origin_trait: "“I was once locked in a place called the Sanctuary of Surasthana, watching people outside suffer in ignorance.\n\nYour nation... also seems to have grown stagnant under a closed, stifled flow of ideas.\n\nLet me open a window for you. Knowledge was never meant to be monopolized.”"

  gacha_nahida_awakened_trait: "Interpreter of Maya’s Dream"
  desc_gacha_nahida_awakened_trait: "“So this is war?\n\nI may not be good at fighting, but to me that fortress’ structure looks as simple as a stack of blocks.\n\nAll we have to do is find the critical ‘node’ and... there, that’s its weak point.\n\nNo rivers of blood are needed—just a small, well-placed collapse.”"

  gacha_nahida_transcended_trait: "Lesser Lord Kusanali"
  desc_gacha_nahida_transcended_trait: "“Governing a nation is like tending a garden.\n\nIf you let the weeds of bureaucracy run wild, the flowers will wither.\n\nI’ll help you comb through the tangled roots of this vast empire... but don’t expect me to control people’s hearts like that ‘false god’ did.”"

  desc_gacha_nahida_c2_trait: "“I’ve linked every corner of this country together.\n\nKnowledge is no longer a privilege for scholars alone, but a blessing that falls over the land like sunlight.\n\nJust watch—once ignorance is driven away, schools of thought will bloom like a thousand roses.\n\nYour people will be the first to greet the dawn.”"

  gacha_nahida_c4_trait: "Skandha Mark · Lockdown"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c4_trait: "“Once you find the structural ‘death point,’ even the strongest walls are nothing but castles of sand.\n\nI’ve already calculated ten thousand ways for the enemy’s defensive line to collapse.\n\nAll that’s left... is a gentle push.\n\nSee? The siege is over.\n\nThat is the power of wisdom.”"

  gacha_nahida_c6_trait: "Lord of Wisdom · Buer"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c6_trait: "“Here, I am no longer a god in chains, nor a piece of history that must be erased.\n\nI am Buer, the one who will guide this great empire toward true understanding.\n\nLet’s break through every research bottleneck.\n\nI want this civilization’s flame to light up places even Irminsul’s branches can’t reach.”"

  # === Events ===
  gacha_nahida_events.1.title: "Buer Nahida — The Green Seed"
  gacha_nahida_events.1.desc: "#ZG At the center of the wishing circle, golden script flows along the carved lines.\nYellowed pages, broken stone rubbings, and faded scraps of picture books whirl above the circle’s heart, then are gently swallowed by a pale green orb rising from the central groove.\nInside the orb, emerald symbols and letters drift about like fireflies.#!\nA small figure is curled up within. Snow-white short hair falls over her shoulders, a simple dress ripples in the flow of light, and a pale green cloak fans out behind her.\nHer eyes are closed, both arms wrapped tightly around a glowing green sphere.\n#ZG With the faintest, glass-like crack, the orb quietly shatters into a sky full of motes.#!\nThe girl opens her eyes and alights softly in the circle’s center, her white dress and the green glow flaring up together.\nThe orb is gone—yet in her palm, there now rests a flower you have never seen before.\n"
  gacha_nahida_events.1.a: "Step forward to take a closer look."

  gacha_nahida_events.10.title: "Buer Nahida — Forgotten ‘Backup’ of the World"
  gacha_nahida_events.10.desc: "“...Scan complete. This is neither the Akasha Terminal, nor the roots of Irminsul.”\n“Nice to meet you. I’m Nahida—once a god of Sumeru... or rather, an ‘old version’ that Irminsul was supposed to delete.”\n“On another, much larger ‘tree,’ the branch that belonged to me was snapped off in an instant. At that moment, a tiny leaf was gathered up by your wish... and that little leaf is what became me as I am now.”\n“I’ve already parsed most of the data reflected in the light curtain just now. Gaps in knowledge, blocked-off currents of thought, reforms that never quite begin... I’m very familiar with these problems.”\n#ZG She looks down at the flower in her hand, then raises her eyes to you.#!\n“Since fate has preserved me—this backup that was meant to disappear—and brought me here, there must be a reason.”\n“I’ll use my wisdom to help you analyze this world’s underlying logic.”\n“In exchange—please take me to see the people of this world. I want to see with my own eyes what kind of blossoms their wisdom will bear.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.10.a: "Welcome, god from afar."

  gacha_nahida_events.2.title: "Growth of Wisdom"
  gacha_nahida_events.2.desc: "Nahida’s power has grown. Verdant Dendro light circles gently around her.\n\n“Look, Irminsul has granted me new strength. With this, I can help everyone even more~”"
  gacha_nahida_events.2.a: "The power of knowledge!"

  gacha_nahida_events.4.title: "History Unrevised"
  gacha_nahida_events.4.desc: "“I am Nahida—Buer, the master of wisdom.\n\nLet me tell you a secret.\n\nIn that distant world of Teyvat, there should still be another ‘Nahida’ governing Sumeru.\n\nShe is probably happier than I am, and more at ease.\n\nBecause she has forgotten the great god who sacrificed herself to save the world, and she has also forgotten that there was once a puppet called ‘Scaramouche’ who tried to become a god.\n\nIrminsul rewrote her memories, making her believe she had always been a flawless god.\n\n...Sometimes, I’m actually a little envious of her.\n\nBut more often, I’m glad that I came here instead.\n\nGlad that the one you summoned... was this version of me.\n\nBecause this painful memory—these truths about sacrifice, betrayal, and redemption—if even I were to forget them...\n\nThen there really would be no one left in all the worlds who remembered that ‘she’ once existed.\n\nThank you, for accepting this imperfect me, who still carries fragments of bygone days.\n\nHere, could we write a history that never needs to be revised?\n\nA history that can still reach a Happy Ending, without anyone having to be sacrificed.\n\nI’ll use all my wisdom to calculate that future for you.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.4.a: "We’ll write it together."

  gacha_nahida_events.11.title: "Roots of Knowledge"
  gacha_nahida_events.11.desc: "“Look—the currents of thought are spreading like roots.\n\nIn the world I came from, people went mad in pursuit of ‘forbidden knowledge.’\n\nBut here, we’ll make wisdom into sunlight that everyone can touch.\n\nDon’t worry about side effects. I’ll be watching over it all the way.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.11.a: "Spread wisdom!"

  gacha_nahida_events.12.title: "Ties of Causality"
  gacha_nahida_events.12.desc: "“Once every enemy is marked with a Skandha Seed, their movements fall neatly into my hands.\n\nHidden supply lines, cracks in city walls—none of them can escape the God of Wisdom’s notice.\n\nThis is what it means to lay siege with insight instead of iron.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.12.a: "See through everything!"

  gacha_nahida_events.13.title: "Surplus Processing Power"
  gacha_nahida_events.13.desc: "“Even without the Akasha, I still haven’t lost the habit of handling vast amounts of data.\n\nSince your scholars are still arguing over those few projects, I went ahead and optimized their research plans for you.\n\nThe extra time you’ve gained... could you spend some of it telling me the fairy tales of this world?”"
  gacha_nahida_events.13.a: "Of course."

  gacha_nahida_events.14.title: "Expanded ‘Void’"
  gacha_nahida_events.14.desc: "“Your borders have grown, and with them the burden of administration.\n\nBut it’s all right—I’ve already recompiled the logic of your bureaucratic system.\n\nNow, even the furthest frontier will be able to hear the voice of wisdom.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.14.a: "Efficient governance!"

  # === C3 Story Chain: Sunshine Outside the Greenhouse ===
  gacha_nahida_c3_title: "Sunshine Outside the Greenhouse"
  
  # Scene 1
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_desc: "Nahida: “...This is illogical.”\n\nIt is late at night in the royal library. Nahida is kneeling on the carpet, surrounded by the daily records and diplomatic files of generations of monarchs. Candlelight flickers, casting her shadow up along the shelves.\n\nShe does not look up. Her fingers continue to glide over the yellowed parchment, as if she were working through an unsolvable equation.\n\nNahida: “According to these three hundred years of records, this country’s ‘inertia’ has always been expansion and plunder. The decision-making model of its rulers has, generation after generation, faithfully followed the greedy algorithm of geopolitics.”\n\nShe stops, turning her head. Her green eyes rest quietly on you.\n\nNahida: “But ever since you took over, that model... has collapsed.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Listen in silence."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"

  # Scene 2
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_2_desc: "She rises to her feet and picks up a decree you just approved. Her gaze is clear, as if she’s already seen through it all.\n\nNahida: “This style of decision-making doesn’t belong to this body, nor to this point in history.”\n\nNahida: “It’s as if... a ‘Watcher’ from a higher dimension were standing outside the board called ‘History’ and had just placed a piece that was never meant to be played.”\n\nShe takes a step closer, her eyes shifting to a spot just behind you.\n\nNahida: “This will... feels as though it’s seeping in from the blank margins of the history books. Rational, and kind—but also tinged with a sort of detached, bird’s-eye distance.”\n\nNahida: “To put it simply—you don’t look like a ruler this world was supposed to have.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Say nothing."

  # Scene 3
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_3_desc: "Nahida points to a well-trimmed bonsai on the windowsill.\n\nNahida: “Your Majesty, this bonsai is a good analogy.”\n\nNahida: “Its roots are confined by the pot, its branches pruned back by the gardener—it was meant to grow into a predetermined shape.”\n\nNahida: “But if a ray of light were to insist on shining through the greenhouse glass at a strange angle...”\n\nNahida: “Then the plant would defy the gardener’s shears and strain toward that light, growing into a completely different shape.”\n\nNahida: “Are you... that ray of light? Will you drive everything toward a worse ending, or a better one? I’m still observing.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Remain silent."

  # Scene 4 (Identity Branch)
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_desc: "There is no judgment in Nahida’s expression—only pure curiosity, and a faint trace of expectation.\n\nShe seems to be waiting for an answer.\n\nFaced with this metaphor, you decide:"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Stay silent, but give a slight nod."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "“I... have merely done what a sovereign must. You’re overthinking this.”"

  # Scene 5
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Nahida gently presses a hand to her chest. A relieved smile blooms on her face.\n\nNahida: “...So you aren’t going to deny it.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Nahida gently presses a hand to her chest. A small, relieved smile blooms on her lips.\n\nNahida: “Is that so... I suppose it’s perfectly normal for a sovereign to make decisions others don’t expect.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "Her palm still rests lightly over her heart, as if feeling some distant echo.\n\nNahida: “I may not have the Akasha’s data to back me up, but... this feeling is not unfamiliar to me.”\n\nShe falls quiet for a moment, as if recalling something long ago."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Wait for her to go on..."

  # Scene 6
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_6_desc: "Nahida closes her eyes. When she speaks again, her voice has softened, like she’s telling a bedtime story.\n\nNahida: “...Let me tell you a story.”\n\nNahida: “Once upon a time, there was a little bird kept inside a cage. The cage was large—so large it could hold the reflection of the whole sky—but the bird itself had never truly flown beyond it.”\n\nNahida: “One day, a ray of light slipped through a crack in the cage. That light did not belong to that sky. It came from very, very far away.”\n\nNahida: “The light stayed with the bird for a while. It taught the bird about the world beyond the cage and helped it unravel many riddles.”\n\nNahida: “Then, one day, the light was gone. The bird thought it must have been nothing but a dream.”\n\nShe opens her eyes, looking straight at you.\n\nNahida: “But if, one day, that little bird were to find itself in a completely unfamiliar world... and feel that same warmth again... Do you think the bird should believe it’s the very same ray of light? Or just another similar dream?”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "“If the warmth is the same, then it’s the same ray of light.”"

  # Scene 7 (Relationship Branch)
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_desc: "Nahida reaches out a hand to you, palm up—half invitation, half confirmation.\n\nNahida: “...If you understood that story, then please allow me one question.”\n\nNahida: “To that ray of light... what is the little bird, now?”\n\nShe pauses, then lets a small smile curl her lips.\n\nNahida: “But the fact that you’re willing to listen to my stories at all at least means this much—you don’t see me as just a tool, do you? At the very least, you’re willing to treat me as someone worth talking to.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "“You’re my external brain. We’ll solve this world’s riddles together.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_opt_b: "“You’re someone I’d want to meet again, in any world.”"

  # Scene 8
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_8_desc: "Nahida takes your hand in hers. Tiny Dendro motes begin to glow in the library, drifting among the particles of dust.\n\nNahida: “...So you did understand that story.”\n\nNahida: “That little bird waited for a very, very long time—so long that she almost forgot what that ray of light looked like. But now, she doesn’t have to wait anymore.”\n\nShe stops and smiles, even more gently than before.\n\nNahida: “Maybe it’s just a story. Maybe the bird just missed that light so much that she began to see it in every bit of warmth.”\n\nNahida: “But even if it is just a mistake, the warmth itself is still real. Thank you... for listening to my story.”\n\nNahida: “This isn’t Teyvat, and there is no Sanctuary of Surasthana here. But as long as that light is here—this place will be my home.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "“This time, there’ll be no cage.”"

  # Scene 9
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Nahida picks up her quill once more, her gaze sharp and confident. For a moment, it’s as if streams of data are flowing behind her.\n\nNahida: “In that case... let’s get to work.”\n\nNahida: “The story is over. What comes next is all calculation. I’ll go on observing...”\n\nNahida: “This world’s underlying logic is much cruder than the Akasha, but it has a beautiful kind of random chaos to it. I’ve already found you the optimal solution.”\n\nNahida: “Let’s prune this bonsai into the shape you want. This time, we’ll be the gardeners.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Nahida looks at you with a smile that is wet with tears and yet full of relief. Behind her, the rising sun seems to blur into the phantom of a great tree.\n\nNahida: “That story... actually has another ending.”\n\nNahida: “The little bird realized that the forest was sick. To heal it, she chose to snap off her own withered branches, willingly turning herself into ash and letting the wind scatter her.”\n\nNahida: “Her last wish was this: ‘Let the forest forget me completely, so that the new shoots can grow without any chains.’”\n\nShe raises her head. Your face is reflected in her green eyes, as if you were the only witness in all the world.\n\nNahida: “According to the script, the world really did forget her. The fledglings that came after were meant to live on in ignorance.”\n\nNahida: “But... even a god of wisdom cannot predict every twist of fate.”\n\nShe hooks out her little finger toward you, her voice as soft as a whisper.\n\nNahida: “Thank you... for listening to me ramble here.”\n\nNahida: “Whatever happens, in this world... you will always be my very first sage.”\n\nNahida: “Good night... and good morning, my very first sage.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Let’s begin, Buer."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Good morning, Nahida. I won’t forget."
