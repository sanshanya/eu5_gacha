  # === Traits ===
  gacha_nahida_origin_trait: "Caged Bird of the Sanctuary"
  desc_gacha_nahida_origin_trait: "“I was once locked inside a cage called the Sanctuary of Surasthana, watching the people outside suffer for lack of knowledge. Your country... seems to have stalled as well, because new ideas cannot circulate. Let me open a window for you. Knowledge should never belong only to the few.”"

  gacha_nahida_awakened_trait: "Interpreter of Maya's Dream"
  desc_gacha_nahida_awakened_trait: "“So this is war? I’m not very good at fighting, but to me that fortress looks as simple as a stack of blocks. As long as we find the critical ‘node’... look, that’s its weak point. No rivers of blood are needed—only a small, well-timed collapse.”"

  gacha_nahida_transcended_trait: "Lesser Lord Kusanali"
  desc_gacha_nahida_transcended_trait: "“Governing a nation is like tending a garden. If you let the weeds of administration grow wild, the flowers are bound to wither. I’ll help you comb through the tangled roots of this great empire... just don’t expect me to become another ‘false god’ who tries to control people’s hearts.”"

  # Constellation Traits
  gacha_nahida_c2_trait: "Morning of a Thousand Roses"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c2_trait: "“I’ve linked every corner of this country together. Knowledge is no longer a privilege of scholars, but a blessing that falls across the land like sunlight. Just watch—once ignorance is pushed back, currents of thought will bloom like a thousand roses. Your people will be the first to greet the dawn.”"

  gacha_nahida_c4_trait: "Skandha Mark · Lockdown"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c4_trait: "“Once you find the structural ‘dead point’, even the strongest walls are nothing more than castles of sand. I’ve already calculated ten thousand ways for the enemy’s defensive line to collapse. All that’s left is a gentle push... look, the siege is over. That is the power of wisdom.”"

  gacha_nahida_c6_trait: "Lord of Wisdom, Buer"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c6_trait: "“Here, I am no longer a god in chains, nor a piece of history that must be erased. I am Buer, the guide who will lead this great empire toward true omniscience. Let’s break through every bottleneck in research. I want this civilization’s firelight to reach places even the branches of the world tree cannot touch.”"

  # === Events ===
  gacha_nahida_events.1.title: "Buer Nahida — The 'Backup' Forgotten by the World"
  gacha_nahida_events.1.desc: "“Nice to meet you. I’m Nahida, the Dendro Archon of Sumeru.\n\n...This is a little strange. In all my records, there is no data at all about this world.\n\nThere is no Akasha Terminal here, nor any roots of Irminsul.\n\nAnd yet... I can finally breathe easier.\n\nBecause here, those ‘erased’ memories are still echoing in my mind.\n\nThat puppet built to house a god, that tree burning itself away, and... that name I must never forget—Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.\n\nSince fate has preserved me—this ‘backup’ that was supposed to vanish—here of all places, there must be a reason.\n\nLet’s treat this as one long ‘dream’ experiment.\n\nI’ll use my wisdom to help you analyze the underlying logic of this world.\n\nIn exchange... would you become my one and only ‘recorder’?”"
  gacha_nahida_events.1.a: "Welcome, God of Wisdom."

  gacha_nahida_events.2.title: "Growth of Wisdom"
  gacha_nahida_events.2.desc: "Nahida’s power has increased, soft green Dendro light circling around her.\n\n“Look, the world tree has granted me new strength. With this, I can help everyone even more~”"
  gacha_nahida_events.2.a: "The power of knowledge!"

  gacha_nahida_events.4.title: "History Unaltered"
  gacha_nahida_events.4.desc: "“I am Nahida—Buer, Lord of Wisdom.\n\nLet me tell you a secret.\n\nIn the distant world of Teyvat, there is probably another ‘Nahida’ still governing Sumeru.\n\nShe might be happier than I am, and her burden lighter.\n\nBecause she has forgotten the great god who sacrificed herself to save the world, and has forgotten that there was once a puppet called ‘the Balladeer’ who sought to become a god.\n\nIrminsul rewrote her memories and led her to believe that she had always been a perfect Archon.\n\n...Sometimes, I envy her.\n\nBut more often, I’m grateful that I came here.\n\nGrateful that the ‘me’ you summoned... is this one.\n\nBecause if even I were to forget these painful memories—this truth about sacrifice, betrayal, and salvation—\n\nthen there would truly be no one left in any world who remembers that ‘she’ once existed.\n\nThank you, for accepting this imperfect me, still bearing the residue of bygone days.\n\nHere, shall we write a history that doesn’t need to be edited by anyone?\n\nA history that can reach a happy ending without anyone having to be sacrificed.\n\nI’ll use all my wisdom to calculate that future for you.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.4.a: "We’ll write it together."

  gacha_nahida_events.11.title: "Roots of Knowledge"
  gacha_nahida_events.11.desc: "“Look, currents of thought are spreading like roots. In my original world, people went mad in their pursuit of ‘forbidden knowledge.’ But here, we’ll make wisdom into sunlight that everyone can touch. Don’t worry about side effects—I’ll be watching over it.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.11.a: "Spread wisdom!"

  gacha_nahida_events.12.title: "Chains of Causality"
  gacha_nahida_events.12.desc: "“Once every enemy is marked with a ‘Skandha Seed,’ their movements are entirely within our grasp. Hidden supply lines, cracks in the walls—before the God of Wisdom, nothing can hide. This is... what it means to lay siege with knowledge.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.12.a: "See through everything!"

  gacha_nahida_events.13.title: "Spare Processing Power"
  gacha_nahida_events.13.desc: "“Even without an Akasha system, I still keep the habit of processing large amounts of data. Since your scholars are still arguing over a few topics, I went ahead and optimized the research plans for you.\n\nAs for the time we saved... could you tell me some of this world’s fairy tales?”"
  gacha_nahida_events.13.a: "Of course."

  gacha_nahida_events.14.title: "Expanding the 'Akasha'"
  gacha_nahida_events.14.desc: "“As the borders of the state expand, the burden of administration grows heavier. But it’s all right—I’ve recompiled the logic of your bureaucracy. Now, even the most distant frontier can hear the voice of wisdom.”"
  gacha_nahida_events.14.a: "Efficient governance!"

  # === C3 Story Chain: Sunlight Beyond the Greenhouse ===
  gacha_nahida_c3_title: "Sunlight Beyond the Greenhouse"

  # Scene 1
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_desc: "Nahida: “...The logic doesn’t hold.”\n\nIt is late at night in the royal library. Nahida kneels on the carpet, surrounded by the private journals and diplomatic papers of past monarchs. Candlelight flickers; her shadow stretches across the bookshelves.\n\nShe does not look up. Her fingertip keeps sliding over the yellowed parchment, as if she were solving an impossible equation.\n\nNahida: “According to three hundred years of historical records, this country’s ‘inertia’ is expansion and plunder. The decision models of its rulers have all strictly followed a greedy algorithm of geopolitics.”\n\nShe stops her hand and turns, her green eyes quietly meeting yours.\n\nNahida: “But since you took over, that model... has collapsed.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Listen in silence."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"

  # Scene 2
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_2_desc: "She rises and picks up a decree you just approved, her gaze clear and incisive.\n\nNahida: “This decision-making style does not belong to this body, nor to this stretch of history.”\n\nNahida: “It is as if there were an ‘observer’ from a higher dimension, dropping a piece onto the board of ‘history’—a piece that was never meant to exist there.”\n\nShe takes a step closer, her eyes seeming to look past you, toward something that is not present in the room.\n\nNahida: “This will... feels like it seeped out from the blank margins of a history book. It is rational and kind, and yet strangely detached, as if viewing everything from above.”\n\nNahida: “To put it simply— you don’t look like a ruler this world was ever supposed to have.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Say nothing."

  # Scene 3
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_3_desc: "Nahida points to a carefully trimmed bonsai on the windowsill.\n\nNahida: “Your Majesty, this country is like this potted tree.”\n\nNahida: “Its roots are confined by the pot, its branches pruned by the gardener. It was meant to grow into a predetermined shape.”\n\nNahida: “But if a ray of light were to shine through the glass of the greenhouse at a strange angle...”\n\nNahida: “The plant would defy the gardener’s shears and strain with all its might toward that light, growing into something completely different.”\n\nNahida: “Are you that ray of light? Will you lead everything toward a worse ending... or a better one? I’m still observing.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Stay silent."

  # Scene 4 (Identity Branch)
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_desc: "There is no judgment in Nahida’s expression—only pure curiosity, and a faint hint of expectation.\n\nShe seems to be waiting for an answer.\n\nFaced with this metaphor, you decide:"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Remain silent, and give a slight nod."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "“I have merely done what a ruler must. You’re overthinking it.”"

  # Scene 5
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Nahida presses a hand lightly to her chest, a relieved smile appearing on her face.\n\nNahida: “...So you’re not denying it.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Nahida presses a hand lightly to her chest, a relieved smile appearing on her face.\n\nNahida: “I see... Well, it’s true that rulers often make choices no one expects.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "Nahida’s palm rests lightly over her heart, as if sensing some distant echo.\n\nNahida: “Even without data from an Akasha system... this feeling is very familiar to me.”\n\nShe falls silent for a moment, as though recalling something far away."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Wait for her to continue..."

  # Scene 6
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_6_desc: "Nahida closes her eyes; her voice turns gentle, like a bedtime story.\n\nNahida: “...Let me tell you a story.”\n\nNahida: “Once, there was a little bird locked inside a cage. The cage was so large it could hold the reflection of the entire sky, but the bird had never truly flown outside.”\n\nNahida: “One day, a ray of light shone through the cracks of the cage. That light did not belong to this sky—it came from very, very far away.”\n\nNahida: “The light stayed with the bird for a time. It showed the bird the world beyond the bars and helped it solve many puzzles.”\n\nNahida: “Then, the light left. The bird thought it had all been a dream.”\n\nShe opens her eyes and looks at you.\n\nNahida: “But if, one day, that bird were to feel the same warmth again in a completely unfamiliar world... Do you think it should believe this is the same ray of light? Or just another similar dream?”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "If the warmth is the same, then it’s the same light."

  # Scene 7 (Relationship Branch)
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_desc: "Nahida reaches a hand out to you, palm up—half invitation, half confirmation.\n\nNahida: “...If you understood that story, then please allow me to ask one more question.”\n\nNahida: “To that ray of light... what is the bird now?”\n\nShe pauses for a beat, then smiles softly.\n\nNahida: “Still, the fact that you were willing to listen means one thing— to you, I’m more than a ‘tool’, aren’t I? At the very least, you’re willing to treat me as someone worth talking to.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "“You’re my external brain. Let’s solve this world’s mysteries together.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_opt_b: "“You’re someone I’d want to meet again, in any world.”"

  # Scene 8
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_8_desc: "Nahida clasps your hand. Green Dendro motes rise into the air of the library, dancing with the dust motes.\n\nNahida: “...So you did understand that story.”\n\nNahida: “That little bird waited for a very, very long time, until it almost forgot what that light even looked like. But now, it doesn’t have to wait anymore.”\n\nShe pauses, her smile growing even softer.\n\nNahida: “Maybe it’s just a story. Maybe the bird simply missed the light so much that it mistook every warmth for its shadow.”\n\nNahida: “But even if it’s an illusion, this warmth is real. Thank you for listening to my story.”\n\nNahida: “This is not Teyvat, and there is no Sanctuary of Surasthana here. But as long as that light is with me... this place is my home.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "This time, there will be no cage."

  # Scene 9
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Nahida picks up her quill again, her eyes sharp and confident; behind her, it’s as if streams of data were flowing through the air.\n\nNahida: “In that case, let’s get to work.”\n\nNahida: “The story is over. Now it’s time for calculations. I’ll keep observing...”\n\nNahida: “The underlying logic of this world is cruder than the Akasha’s, but it has a kind of beautiful, chaotic randomness. I’ve already found the optimal solutions for you.”\n\nNahida: “Let’s prune this bonsai into whatever shape you desire. This time, the gardeners are us.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Nahida looks at you with eyes shining with tears, yet utterly at peace. Behind her, the rising sun seems to overlap with the phantom of a world tree.\n\nNahida: “That story... actually has one more ending.”\n\nNahida: “The little bird realized the forest was sick. To heal the forest, she chose to snap off her own withered branches and let herself turn to ash, scattered on the wind.”\n\nNahida: “Her final wish was: ‘Let the forest forget me completely, so that the new shoots may grow without any burden.’”\n\nShe lifts her head; your face is reflected in her green eyes, as if you were the only witness in the world.\n\nNahida: “According to the script, the world really did forget her. The new birds were meant to live their lives knowing nothing at all.”\n\nNahida: “But... even a god of wisdom cannot fully predict fate.”\n\nShe hooks out her little finger toward you, her voice soft:\n\nNahida: “Thank you... for listening to my rambling here.”\n\nNahida: “No matter what, in this world, you are... my very first sage.”\n\nNahida: “Good night... and good morning, my first sage.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Let’s begin, Buer."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Good morning, Nahida. I’ll remember this—always."
