  desc_gacha_klee_c2_trait: "“Eh? Why did those walls all fall down by themselves? It must be because they wanted to play with Klee too! Look, the soldier uncles are all laughing so happily.

C’mon, let’s turn the whole world into our playground!”"

  gacha_klee_events.1.desc: "A harmless puff of pink smoke pops outside the palace window—then a red-and-white bundle tumbles in atop Dodoco. Klee squints around for a ‘commander,’ spots you, and brandishes a Jumpy Dumpty like a business card, grinning ear to ear.\n\nShe’s waiting for your response before she shows off her ‘explosive résumé.’"
  gacha_klee_events.1.a: "Ask her to set the bomb down and speak."

  gacha_klee_events.10.title: "Knights of Favonius · Spark Knight Klee — Your (Highly Hazardous) Mascot"
  gacha_klee_events.10.desc: "“Dah-dah-dah~! Klee’s here!\n\nHuh? This isn’t the confinement room, or the Knights’ headquarters…\n\nWaaah, what a big map! Are all those red flags the bad guys? Are those little blocks with walls drawn on them the rocks we use for blasting fish?\n\nI’m the Spark Knight Klee! Captain Jean always says I’m too naughty, but I’m super strong, you know!\n\nAnything that goes boom-boom, or any hard, hard walls—just leave them to Klee!\n\nUm… in exchange, could you *not* confiscate my Jumpy Dumpties?\n\nI’ll be really good! Probably… only one explosion a day?\n\nOh, oh, and do you have yummy Calla Lilies here too?”"

  gacha_klee_events.4.title: "In the Name of Sparks"
  gacha_klee_events.4.desc: "“I’m the Spark Knight Klee.\n\nWhen I first came here, I was actually a little bit scared.\n\nThere was no Captain Jean nagging me, no Albedo drawing pictures, and no Kaeya to help write my apology letters.\n\nI was afraid that if I blew something up by accident, you’d throw me out like a stranger.\n\nBut… you didn’t.\n\nEvery time I blasted a gap in the walls, you’d pat my head and say, ‘Nice work.’\n\nEvery time I turned the enemy’s position into scorched earth, you’d stand in front of me and block all those angry stares.\n\nHehe, it feels just like being at home.\n\nNow, this big, big realm is Klee’s new home!\n\nNo matter how thick the walls, or how bad the bad guys are,\n\nas long as it’s to protect you, and to protect our home,\n\nKlee will blow them all away!\n\nThat’s the Spark Knight’s promise!\n\n…Um, so, can we skip my confinement today?”"
  gacha_klee_events.4.a: "Of course, my little knight."

  gacha_klee_events.11.title: "Doesn’t Even Need a Push"
  gacha_klee_events.11.desc: "“Why did those enemy walls just fall down all by themselves? Hmm… maybe it’s because Klee buried a few ‘treasures’ over there just now? Hehe, is this what Captain Jean calls ‘subduing the enemy without… what was it… fighting’? Isn’t Klee super smart?”"
  gacha_klee_events.11.a: "Brilliantly smart!"

  gacha_klee_events.12.title: "Art Is an Explosion!"
  gacha_klee_events.12.desc: "“Full salvo! Rat-a-ta-ta—! Look, that fortress just burst open like a giant firework! So pretty! It’s kind of a pity the land turned all black and sooty… but that means we won, right? Will you praise Klee?”"

  # === C3 Story: Gardener of the Scorched Earth ===
  gacha_klee_c3_title: "Gardener on the Scorched Earth"

  # Scene 1
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_1_desc: "The long siege has finally ended. It was a price that had to be paid for the empire’s unification.\n\nYou walk across the newly conquered land. The air reeks of burnt charcoal; every inch underfoot records a spike in devastation and the accompanying penalties to your administration.\n\nIt was a necessary destruction—but as the ruler, faced with so much ruin, you still feel a weight in your chest.\n\nUntil, at the center of a massive crater, you notice a splash of red, vividly out of place."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Approach that figure."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip this story"

  # Scene 2
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_2_desc: "It’s Klee. The fortress that held up your armies for three months finally fell to her sparks.\n\nNow, this “walking calamity” who makes enemy troops tremble is quietly focused on the scorched earth at her feet.\n\nShe isn’t celebrating victory, nor searching for loot. Her movements are as gentle as if she were tending a newborn Dodoco—so gentle it clashes chillingly with the slaughter all around."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Watch in silence."

  # Scene 3
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_3_desc: "Klee turns around, cradling a little wildflower with slightly yellowed petals that she dug up from who-knows-where. Soot smudges her face, but her eyes are terrifyingly clear.\n\nKlee: “...Ah, did you come to confiscate my bombs?”\n\nShe reflexively shields the pit behind her, then shakes her head and lets her hands fall.\n\nKlee: “No, there aren’t any bombs here anymore. All the bombs turned into fireworks and flew up into the sky.”\n\nShe points at the scorched patch behind her, where she just buried a tiny seed.\n\nKlee: “I’m planting flowers. Captain Jean said that in places that got burned, the grass that grows next year will be super tall.”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Squat down: so you’re planting flowers."

  # Scene 4
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_4_desc: "Klee looks over the ruins around her. There’s not a trace of fear in her eyes—only a pure, unsettling anticipation.\n\nKlee: “Before, there were waaay too many houses here. They blocked all the sunlight. Everyone was squeezed into dark, narrow alleys, and nobody was happy.”\n\nKlee: “Now it’s better! All the houses are gone, so the sunlight can shine on every little bit of land!”\n\nShe fixes those innocent eyes on you and speaks a truth as cruel as it is simple:\n\nKlee: “Only if you blow up *all* the old things can the new ones have room to grow, right?”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "You’re right. Rotten orders must be purified by fire."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "But all those things you blew up used to be someone’s home."

  # Scene 5
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "She laughs happily, as if she’s finally found someone who understands."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "She frowns in confusion, then seriously argues back."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "Klee: “But… if you don’t blow them up, they’ll just keep rotting there, you know? Like a lake that doesn’t flow will start to stink.”\n\nKlee: “My mom once told me a story. She said: a long, long time ago, there was a really, really big forest…”\n\nKlee: “The old trees in the forest grew too tall and too dense. They blocked out all the sun, and not a single sapling could grow.”\n\nKlee: “Then one day, a bolt of lightning came down—‘BOOOM!’—and the whole forest burned! The next spring, so many new sprouts grew out of the black ashes!”\n\nShe recites the line that’s far too heavy for a child like she’s reciting scripture:\n\nKlee: “Mom said: ‘Civilization is like an overgrown forest. When the ancient trees block all the light, only the cruelty of flame can awaken the sprouts sleeping beneath the humus.’”\n\nKlee: “I don’t really get what ‘humus’ means… but Mom definitely meant that broken things are just fertilizer that hasn’t been exploded yet!”\n\nKlee: “As long as you use sparks to go ‘KA-BOOM!’ and turn them into ash, they can become the foundation for new houses and the fertilizer for flowers! That’s the ‘prelude to new life’!”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "A ‘prelude to new life’? Compared to our great goal, it really is just a prelude."

  # Scene 6
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_6_desc: "You look at her.\n\nIn her eyes, those shattered fortresses and burned libraries are nothing more than ‘old trees’ blocking out the light. The old nobles wailing among the ruins are just withered roots clinging to the soil, waiting to be turned into humus.\n\nIn this child’s logic, war isn’t the continuation of politics, but of life-force. A sclerotic empire needs to breathe, and her sparks are the hammer that cracks the shell. Explosions exist so that growth can rage even fiercer."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Meet her gaze: she understands the cost of ‘development’ better than anyone."

  # Scene 7 (Locked)
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "Klee: “Will you be mad at me? For making everything all bald and empty?”\n\nShe looks at you nervously, fingers twisting together.\n\nKlee: “But if we just wait, really just wait a little, it’ll become even prettier than before!”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "Klee: “Will you be mad at me? For making everything all bald and empty?”\n\nShe looks at you nervously, fingers twisting together.\n\nKlee: “But if we just wait, really just wait a little, it’ll become even prettier than before!”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "You’re right. We’re not making ruins; we’re plowing fields for the future."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_7_opt_b: "The flowers will bloom. Until then, I’ll guard this land—scars and all."

  # Scene 8
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_8_desc: "Hearing your answer, the unease in Klee’s eyes fades away.\n\nKlee: “Mm! Plowing fields! Klee is the best gardener in all of Teyvat—no, in the whole world!”\n\nShe jumps to her feet and stretches out her arms as if to embrace the scarred land before her.\n\nKlee: “We’ll blow up all the walls that get in the way, and all the broken, rotten houses too…”\n\nKlee: “Someday, the whole world will turn into one big garden, and everyone will be able to run around wherever they want!”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Take her hand: come on, we’ve got a lot of ground to ‘plow’."

  # Scene 9
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "You stand side by side with Klee atop the ruins, gazing out over lands not yet conquered. The corner of her backpack bulges with yet more bombs.\n\nYou take her small, soot-stained hand.\n\nYou: “Yes. For that great garden, we’ll need many more sparks.”\n\nKlee nods vigorously, and the Jumpy Dumpties in her pack seem to hum along in excitement.\n\nKlee: “Leave it to me! Wherever there’s a rotten smell, that’s where Klee will go to set off fireworks!”\n\nAll who hinder the empire’s growth are but weeds."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "You crouch down to meet the tiny flower growing in the charred earth eye-to-eye. Klee stands beside you, carefully brushing the ash from your face.\n\nYou accept the necessity of war, but you also decide not to let that cruelty devour her heart.\n\nYou: “This flower is beautiful. But remember—after you set a fire, you must remember to sow seeds.”\n\nKlee looks at you, half understanding and half not, then breaks into a radiant smile.\n\nKlee: “I don’t really get it… but as long as I’m with you, even on pitch-black scorched earth, I still feel warm!”"
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_9_opt_a_new: "All for new life."
  gacha_klee_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Let’s go home, Klee."
