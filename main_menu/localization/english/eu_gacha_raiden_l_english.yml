  gacha_raiden_events.1.desc: "#ZG No wind stirs at the center of the wishing circle; even the motes of dust in the air are forced to stillness.\nAs the golden script crosses into the heart of the array, it twists at once into a shrill violet radiance.\nThere are no cluttered trinkets, no mundane debris—only a few crimson sakura petals, frozen in mid-air by an absolute power, neither falling nor fading.\nWithin this forcibly carved pocket of stagnant time, a great sphere of light hangs suspended.#!\nA violet-haired woman floats cross-legged within the lightning, eyes closed.\nArcs of electricity coil about her in suffocating silence, her expression cold as ice, like a finely wrought doll that long ago surpassed life and death, sunk in endless meditation.\n#ZG In the air there is only\nsilence\nand the slow, deep beat of a heart.#!"

Your realm is rife with needless ‘noise.’”\n“Since you have awakened me, it can only mean you yearn for unchanging law.”\n“Very well. I shall sweep aside all that stands in the way of ‘Eternity’—be it an enemy host abroad, or deluded fancies at home.”\n#ZG She turns, presenting you her back as she calmly wipes down her blade.#!\n“If you cannot keep pace with me, or if you are swallowed by so-called ‘wear and tear’...”\n“I shall cut you down without hesitation.”\n“—Do not disappoint me.”"

  gacha_raiden_events.4.title: "To Walk Beside the Sovereign"
  gacha_raiden_events.4.desc: "“I am Raiden Ei.\n\nAcross long ages, I sealed myself within the ‘Plane of Euthymia,’ letting the ‘Shogun’ carry out the decrees of eternity in my place.\n\nI have witnessed too much loss—so I sought to bind time.\n\nI have witnessed too much erosion—so I sought to freeze all wishes.\n\nWhen I first arrived here, I thought this was simply another mortal nation doomed to destruction.\n\nI was prepared to sever every variable, just as I once did in Inazuma.\n\nBut... you are different.\n\nYou shielded the weak in the midst of war. You kept a true heart amid the games of power.\n\nYou have shown me that even mortals as fleeting as morning dew can burn brighter than the stars.\n\n‘The Shogun’ shall remain your blade, shattering all your enemies in a single stroke.\n\nAs for me...\n\nI shall set the thunder aside, and brew a pot of tea for you.\n\nDo not fear erosion. Do not fear the end.\n\nSo long as you continue forward, I shall, with this body, make this vow—\n\nYour realm shall be eternity.”"

  # === C3 Affection Event: “Logistics Inspection” on a Stormy Night ===
  gacha_raiden_c3_title: "“Logistics Inspection” on a Stormy Night"
  
  # Scene 1: Divine Presence
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_1_desc: "Violet arcs of lightning crawl along the outer walls of the imperial study, the air thick with ozone. Attendants keep a wide berth; only you brave the prickling static to push open the heavy door.\n\nThis thunderstorm is no act of nature, but the overflow of pressure from on high."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Enter the imperial study: audience with that peerless presence."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"

  # Scene 2: Time Held Still
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_2_desc: "The Shogun hovers half a span above the floor, lightning circling her as she faces the storm-dark night beyond the window.\n\nHer voice sounds directly within your mind:\n\n“Electro in this world is... disordered.\n\nChaotic in structure, and feeble besides.”\n\nOn the desk lie battle manuals, ledgers, and memorials, all pushed aside."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Bow your head: “Your Excellency, what decree brings you here so late?”"

  # Scene 3: Erosion of Eternity
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_3_desc: "She turns slowly, pointing with one finger at the scattered documents.\n\n“I have perused the so-called ‘pastimes’ you had them present. Histories, art of war, philosophy... all lifeless repetition.\n\nStare at this stagnant water long enough, and even I will be corroded by a rust named ‘tedium.’”\n\n“Mortal sovereign, is there truly nothing in your realm... that carries the worth of a ‘variable’?”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Fall silent in thought: a variable..."

  # Scene 4: A Different Kind of Tribute (route lock)
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_4_desc: "Before a god’s questioning, customary tributes are meaningless.\n\nAt your command, the attendants bring in a different sort of offering. Once the room is clear, you place it before Ei."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Present a novel: “A popular work from distant lands—absurd on the surface, but filled with mortals’ boldest wild ideas.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Present sweets: “A confection perfected in the kitchens after a thousand trials, all for a single moment of satisfaction.”"

  # Scene 5: Appraisal
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Ei reads the overly long title without much interest. “Reborn in Another World, I Shall Become a Grand Duke as Well? Presumptuous.”\n\nShe flips open to the first page, her gaze gradually sharpening. “The protagonist abandons divine favor to overturn fate with mortal hands alone?\n\nArrogant... yet a usable sample for observation.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "She regards the syrup-glazed dumplings. “Milk and glutinous rice in concert? Its appearance is inferior to those of Inazuma, perhaps, but the scent differs from ordinary field rations.”\n\nShe lifts a skewer—graceful, yet without the slightest hesitation."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "A crash of thunder shakes the rafters. She does not so much as blink, all her attention fixed upon this small spark of novelty."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Stand quietly at her side."

  # Scene 6: Stillness
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_desc_a: "She takes a seat, the electric field around her receding. Cradling the book, her brows relax and furrow by turns, as though she were reviewing a critical battle report.\n\n“...Acceptable. This thread of novelty lets time possess the faintest sense of weight.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_desc_b: "She takes a seat, the electric field around her receding. She eats the dumplings in small, measured bites, her expression utterly focused, as if engaged in a precise elemental refinement.\n\n“...Acceptable. This thread of novelty lets time possess the faintest sense of weight.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_desc_common: "\n\nShe sits, and the thunderfield ebbs away."
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Wait in silence."

  # Scene 7: Judgment
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "“The prose is crude, the logic flawed—but this will to ‘break fate’ is not without merit.\n\nOn occasion, mortals’ wildest fantasies may brush against the edge of truth.”\n\n“Bring any such tomes that record ‘variables’ from other worlds straight to me. I grant you leave to submit them.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "“The texture is soft, the sweetness measured. It calms the mind and steadies the spirit—of use in maintaining a meditative state.\n\nAs military supplies, it passes.”\n\n“If there are materials that aid ‘stability of mind,’ they need not await my prior inspection—only you may present them.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Bow your head: “As you command.”"

  # Scene 8: The Rain Lets Up
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_8_desc: "Outside, the rain has stopped, and moonlight spills across the armor stands.\n\nShe straightens her sleeves; the softness of Ei recedes, and the Shogun takes command once more.\n\n“Rest is concluded. Tedium abated.\n\nLet all return to their duties.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Step back: “We respectfully see the Shogun off.”"

  # Scene 9: Endings
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Ei still holds the novel in one hand.\n\n“This volume will be requisitioned for now.\n\nAs for the protagonist’s choice in the fifth chapter—come to the study after morning court tomorrow.\n\nI take issue with it, and would debate the matter with you.”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "“As you wish, Shogun.”"

  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Ei pauses at the doorway, her gaze drifting toward the now-empty food box upon the desk.\n\n“That variety of dumpling from earlier—if the glutinous rice and milk can be fully blended into a drinkable form, intake would be more efficient.\n\nThis is a logistics improvement directive of ‘highest priority.’”"
  gacha_raiden_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "“I shall carry out your will.”"
