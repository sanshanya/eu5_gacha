  desc_gacha_keqing_origin_trait: "“Standing here for just a moment, I could almost see Liyue Harbor’s forest of sails racing across the water...\n\nNo, that’s not quite right.

  # === Events ===
  gacha_keqing_events.1.title: "Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing — A ‘Cat-Eared’ Girl?"
  gacha_keqing_events.1.desc: "#ZG At the center of the wishing circle, golden script flows along the carved lines.\nAccount books, tax registers, engineering blueprints and annotated documents whirl above the circle’s heart, only to be gently swallowed by a mass of violet lightning rising from the central groove.\nWithin the light, arcs of electricity weave together like threads, outlining some precise geometric figure. A girl sits cross-legged at its center.#!\nViolet hair falls over her shoulders, her cloak folded neatly across her knees. She clutches an account book that has yet to be closed, her fingertip still resting on a line of figures she hasn’t finished checking. Even in sleep, a faint crease between her brows speaks of focus. \n#ZG A bolt of lightning jumps from her fingertip and strikes the surface of the sphere.\nWith a soft crack, the shell quietly shatters, and the scattered motes are drawn back into the array.#!"
  gacha_keqing_events.1.a: "Step forward to take a closer look."

  gacha_keqing_events.10.title: "Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing — Time for Reform"
  gacha_keqing_events.10.desc: "#ZG The girl opens her eyes and lands crisply in the center of the circle, her skirt and streaks of violet lightning flaring upward together.\nShe takes in her surroundings at a glance, her gaze sharp as a blade as it sweeps across every detail of the summoning array—then her brows knit together.#!\n“Is this... a summoning ritual from another world?”\n#ZG She turns toward you, arms folding across her chest.#! “I’m Keqing, the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Since I’ve answered your summons, I’ll get straight to the point.”\n“While I was in the light, I skimmed through your administrative ledgers and infrastructure plans.”\n#ZG She extends a finger and lets out a quiet sigh—only for a spark of excitement to flash in her eyes.#! “Far too slow. Far too inefficient. How is a creaking old bureaucracy like this supposed to withstand the storms to come?”\n“Then again... it also means there’s a lot of room for reform.”\n#ZG She straightens her attire and holds a hand out to you.#!\n“I’ll help you reshape the order of this nation. But steel yourself first.”\n“My pace is very fast.”\n“Don’t fall behind, all right... partner who calls yourself ‘sovereign’?”"
  gacha_keqing_events.10.a: "Then I’ll be counting on you, Yuheng."

  gacha_keqing_events.2.title: "Efficiency Boost"

  gacha_keqing_events.2.a: "Maintain this pace!"

  gacha_keqing_events.4.title: "Man Triumphs Over Heaven"
  gacha_keqing_events.4.desc: "“I’m Keqing, the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing.\n\nBack in Liyue, I was always the one running too fast and leaving everyone else behind.\n\nI used to worry that, in this unfamiliar world, I’d be the only one sprinting in the name of ‘efficiency,’ pointlessly exhausting myself.\n\nBut you kept up.\n\nNo matter how demanding a reform plan I put forward, no matter how insane a marching speed I asked for...\n\nyou never complained. You never stopped.\n\nSeeing how this once-barren land has grown into a forest of towers with thriving trade routes, I suddenly understood something:\n\n‘Golden ages’ are not blessings granted by the gods. They’re forged by two like-minded people slogging through countless late nights of overtime.\n\n...Thank you.\n\nNot just for this country, but for... staying by the side of someone as stubborn as me.\n\nAll right, sentimentality time is over.\n\nGrab the files—we’re off to inspect the next province.\n\nAs long as it’s with you...\n\nI believe we can carry this ‘age of human rule’ all the way to the end of time.”"
  gacha_keqing_events.4.a: "Let’s go. Our work isn’t done yet!"

  gacha_keqing_events.11.title: "Laying the Foundations of Splendor"
  gacha_keqing_events.11.desc: "“Hear that? That’s the sound of hammers striking stone—that’s the heartbeat of the state.\n\nIf we want to build a golden age, the foundations have to be firmer than bedrock.\n\nThe current construction speed is just about acceptable to me now... but only just.”"
  gacha_keqing_events.11.a: "We’ll do even better."

  gacha_keqing_events.12.title: "Blade Like My Will"
  gacha_keqing_events.12.desc: "“There’s no hesitation left in my sword work.\n\nA battlefield is no different from a workplace. No matter how stubborn the ‘opponent’ in front of me, I’ll ‘optimize’ them with lightning speed.\n\nDon’t worry about the flanks—I’ll be in every place I’m needed, all at once.”"
  gacha_keqing_events.12.a: "That’s the Yuheng’s speed!"

  gacha_keqing_events.13.title: "Every Inch a Treasure"
  gacha_keqing_events.13.desc: "“I’ve looked over your city plans—far too much space is being wasted.\n\nWith just a bit of smart re-zoning, we can fit in more workshops and markets.\n\nSee? Like this... The principle that every inch of land is precious holds true in any world.”"
  gacha_keqing_events.13.a: "Implement the new layout at once."

  gacha_keqing_events.14.title: "Thirst for Talent"
  gacha_keqing_events.14.desc: "“If we want to keep up reforms at this intensity, the two of us alone won’t be enough.\n\nI’ve redrawn the standards for recruitment and stripped away a lot of pointless red tape.\n\nNow, let’s bring in those truly capable people—and at far more reasonable costs.”"
  gacha_keqing_events.14.a: "Employ talent wherever it’s found."

  # === C3 Affection Event: A ‘Little Break’ Amid the Lanterns ===
  gacha_keqing_c3_title: "A ‘Little Break’ Amid the Lanterns"
  
  # Scene 1: An Ever-Burning Light
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_1_desc: "Night has grown deep. The palace has slipped into slumber—save for the light still burning in the imperial study.\n\nThis is Keqing’s third all-nighter in a row. She insists on single-handedly reforging trade routes, mines, and ledgers from the ground up.\n\nYou carry a food box still warm from the imperial kitchens, the heat seeping through the wood into your palm."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Push the door open: it’s time to make her stop."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"
  
  # Scene 2: The Yuheng’s Silhouette
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_2_desc: "Keqing is bent over her desk, brush flying. Scrolls and maps are piled high around her.\n\nKeqing: “...Trim the budget for this canal another ten percent... The old nobles’ books don’t add up... have the Ministry of Revenue reconvene tomorrow. And the craftsmen need to adjust these plans... Hm?”\n\nSharp as ever, she senses the change in the air; her brush pauses in mid-stroke."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Walk up to the desk: it’s me."

  # Scene 3: A Stilled Lightning Stiletto
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_3_desc: "She whirls around. When she sees it’s you, sternness melts into surprise, and she hurriedly tries to tidy her rumpled sleeves.\n\nThen, in the thick silence, a loud “growl~” breaks the tension.\n\nThe face usually etched with ‘severity’ and ‘reform’ suddenly flushes with an unmistakably human embarrassment."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Stifle a laugh: even the Yuheng lives in a mortal body."

  # Scene 4: A Battle of Wills (Route Lock)
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_4_desc: "Keqing turns away, bracing both hands on the desk as if to salvage her aura.\n\nKeqing: “That’s a normal reaction! My energy’s still more than enough. These documents all have to be handled tonight.”\n\nFaced with someone who is harsher on herself than anyone else, you decide:"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Appeal to her swordsmanship: “Too much hardness leads to breaking. Even the finest blade needs to return to its sheath to regain its edge.”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Lead with warmth and food: “(You open the box.) No decree outranks freshly-fried golden shrimp balls.”"

  # Scene 5: Returning to the Sheath
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Keqing freezes, her shoulders dropping.\n\nKeqing: “...Return to the sheath to regain its edge? ...You’re right. If a blade chips, it can’t cut a path through upheaval.\n\nI’ve been too impatient.”\n\nShe sets the brush down. There’s a new, relieved softness in her eyes at being understood."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "The aroma hits her, and her defenses collapse on the spot.\n\nKeqing: “Bringing this out at a time like this... that’s completely unfair...”\n\nHer gaze softens, her body leaning unconsciously toward the food box."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "She sits, looking at the dishes, her expression uncharacteristically gentle.\n\nKeqing: “Back in Liyue, when I was pushing deadlines, I often forgot to eat. I kept thinking if I ran fast enough, I could change the world, so people wouldn’t need to rely on gods anymore.”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Hand her the chopsticks: you’ll need strength if you want to keep running."

  # Scene 6: Old Habits
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_6_desc: "Keqing picks up a shrimp ball and takes a small bite, critiquing the flavor even as she eats rather quickly.\n\nAfter the first one, her left hand reaches automatically for the documents—then stops halfway.\n\nShe looks at the chopsticks, then at your eyes, and slowly draws her hand back, folding it properly over her lap.\n\nKeqing: “...Thank you. This is probably the most ‘extravagant’ rest I’ve had since coming here.”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Watch her eat: slow down, no one’s going to snatch it from you."

  # Scene 7: What’s in Her Heart (Route Lock)
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "Keqing looks out into the night, her features finally relaxed.\n\nKeqing: “Your Majesty, I’m glad it was you I met in this world.\n\nYou don’t treat me like some anomaly, and you’re not scared off by how radical I can be.\n\nYou understand how urgent I feel—and how tired I get.\n\nWith you beside me, the age of human rule will come, sooner or later.”\n\nShe turns back, eyes bright and steady—recognition offered to a comrade-in-arms."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "Keqing lowers her gaze, fingers playing with the handle of the now-empty food box.\n\nKeqing: “You’re always like this—a dignified monarch who still remembers these little, trivial things.\n\nIn front of you, that stiff, ‘proper’ mask just doesn’t stay on.”\n\nKeqing: “Next time... could you teach me how to make this? I want to cook it myself—for you.”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Make that promise here and now."

  # Scene 8: Dawn
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_8_desc_a: "First light seeps into the sky. Keqing rises, straightening her clothes, a faint smile on her lips.\n\nKeqing: “Rest period over. Dawn is coming.\n\nAfter this ‘return to the sheath,’ I feel like there’s nothing I can’t cut through now.”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_8_desc_b: "First light seeps into the sky. Keqing props her chin on her hand as she looks at you, gaze unusually gentle.\n\nKeqing: “Time passed so quickly. We didn’t even get any ‘real work’ done—just a midnight snack...\n\nBut with your thoughtfulness, the new day doesn’t feel quite so overwhelming.”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Get ready to head out..."

  # Scene 9: Endings
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Keqing stands before the great strategic map, full of spirit as she points toward the provinces.\n\nKeqing: “At court today, I’ll present a new proposal. With the two of us working together, there’s no old rule we can’t break.\n\nCome on, partner—let’s go build our golden age!”"
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Let’s go!"

  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Keqing walks you to the door, her finger still hooked through the handle of the empty food box.\n\nKeqing: “If you don’t mind... could you bring something again tomorrow night?\n\nIn return, I’ll finish everything two hours early... and then we can go walk the city? I heard the night market sells paper lanterns that glow... like the lanterns back home during the Lantern Rite.\n\nI want to go see them with you—no state business, just looking.”\n\nMoonlight slides down along the eaves. In her hopeful gaze, it shines brighter than any grand blueprint."
  gacha_keqing_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "It’s a promise."
