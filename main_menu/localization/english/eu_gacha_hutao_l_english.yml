  # === Traits ===
  gacha_hutao_origin_trait: "Wangsheng Business Expansion"
  desc_gacha_hutao_origin_trait: "“The people of your country seem awfully afraid of dying, huh? That won’t do at all—the more they fear it, the easier they are to panic.\n\nBirth, aging, sickness and death are just the laws of nature, as natural as breathing.\n\nLet me help you spread a little of Wangsheng’s ‘passing on’ philosophy. Once everyone’s hearts are at ease, their days will settle down too.”"

  gacha_hutao_awakened_trait: "Crimson Procession Clears the Way"
  desc_gacha_hutao_awakened_trait: "“You think I don’t know how to fight? Ah, now you’re underestimating me.\n\nOnly someone who’s seen more life and death than most knows how to send people on their way as quickly as possible.\n\nDon’t worry—friend or foe, once they fall, the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor will make sure everyone gets a fair spot on the other side.”"

  gacha_hutao_transcended_trait: "Guide of the Spirit Butterflies"
  desc_gacha_hutao_transcended_trait: "“You’re really putting me on the throne? Hehe, well, why not.\n\nUnder my rule, yin and yang will be in proper order, and both the living and the dead will rest easy.\n\nWhile you’re alive, things will be lively and bustling; once you go, it’ll be dignified and proper.\n\nIsn’t that the most perfect kind of golden age?”"

  gacha_hutao_c2_trait: "Border · Requiem of Rest"
  desc_gacha_hutao_c2_trait: "“Yin and yang in order, all things thriving.\n\nI’ve set boundary steles at the four corners of this realm.\n\nThe dead rest underground, returning as spring soil; the living feel no fear before the fires of war, and life goes on, and on.\n\nListen—that’s the song of souls returning home... and the heartbeat of a growing nation.”"

  gacha_hutao_c4_trait: "Crimson Host · Butterfly Flames Ablaze"
  desc_gacha_hutao_c4_trait: "“If words can’t talk the wicked spirits down, then we’ll just use fire to purify them!\n\nMy little butterflies will flutter across the battlefield, and every blossom of flame is another enemy sent to the far shore.\n\nDon’t blink—this is a grand funeral rite called ‘annihilation’!”"

  gacha_hutao_c6_trait: "Sovereign of the Netherworld · Cycle"
  desc_gacha_hutao_c6_trait: "“From this seat, I see far more partings of life and death than before.\n\nBut that’s exactly why life feels so precious, isn’t it?\n\nThere’s no need to fear the end—I’m the gatekeeper, after all.\n\nAs long as I’m here, this country’s allotted span isn’t over yet.\n\nSo raise a little more hell, Your Majesty!”"

  gacha_hutao_events.1.desc: "#ZG At the heart of the wishing circle, golden script flows along the carved grooves.\nTorn account pages, talismans for warding spirits, and scattered playing cards whirl overhead, only to be gently swallowed by a bloom of orange-red flame rising from the central notch.\nWithin the glowing sphere, fire butterflies and soul-lanterns flicker faintly along the inner surface, golden sigils and blood-red flame patterns looping in ring after ring.\nA girl lies curled up inside, hugging a plump white spirit.\nChestnut hair curls slightly in the firelight, and a dark red robe rests quietly against her.#!She’s cuddling a white ghost with a dopey expression, cheek rubbing against its soft belly, a glimmer of drool at the corner of her mouth.\n#ZG A fire butterfly lands on the tip of her nose.\nWith a soft pop, the flames scatter like petals on the wind.#!"

Eh??!」\n#ZG Her eyes snap open, plum blossom pupils glittering in the firelight.#!\n「This isn’t the game table... or the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor...」\n#ZG She looks around—at the golden wishing array, at the palace silhouette in the distance. Confusion turns to surprise, then settles into an impish grin.#!\n「My, my... I was just up late playing Genius Invokation, and the next thing I know I’ve popped right out in front of a client—no, an honored guest~」\n#ZG She brushes off her clothes, straightens her hat, then slips effortlessly into a textbook salesperson pose, one hand raised, smile beaming:#!「Pleased to meet you! I’m Hu Tao, 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor in Liyue！」\n「And this place of yours... tsk, tsk. The baleful aura is thick—border wars blazing, palace undercurrents churning. That’s a huge busi— ahem, a huge crisis waiting to happen！」\n#ZG She leans in closer, lowers her voice, and winks:#!「I don’t really know how I ended up here either, but since I’m here, let’s call it fate! How about hiring me as your special consultant？」\n「Sign the contract now, and I’ll give you twenty percent off your future state funeral！」\n「Kidding, kidding~ don’t make such a serious face!」"

  gacha_hutao_events.4.desc: "「Yo, VIP customer！... Ah, I mean, Your Majesty.\n\nWhy are you sitting here alone spacing out again?\n\nWorried about the fighting on the borders, or wondering who’ll inherit all this when you’re a hundred years gone?\n\nHehe, to ordinary folks, those are pretty earth-shaking worries.\n\nBut let me tell you, I’ve seen too much of it at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\n\nArrogant generals, merchants richer than nations—no matter who they are, in the end they’re all the same handful of ash in the same-sized box.\n\nSo don’t cling too hard to that hazy thing called ‘eternity.’\n\nBurn bright instead, like a fire butterfly!\n\nCarve your name into the stone of history, burn your will into this land.\n\nAs for the rest...\n\nThe shades lurking in the dark, the regrets left behind, the farewells that must one day come...\n\nJust leave all that to me.\n\nI’m Hu Tao, 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\n\nAs long as I’m standing behind you, the rules between the two realms won’t fall into chaos.\n\nAll right, spacing-out time is over! Come on, let’s go to the imperial garden and give that new minister a little scare！」"

  gacha_hutao_events.13.desc: "「I took one look and saw all your ministers with dark shadows on their brows—definitely from overwork!\n\nSo I gave each of them a nice little ‘buy one, get one free’ coupon... Eh? Why are they running faster than rabbits?\n\nTsk, such a lack of appreciation. This is the Hall Master’s care and concern, you know！」"

  gacha_hutao_c3_title: "Doggerel in the Back Alleys"
  
  # Scene 1: A Chill at Your Back
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_1_desc: "Having finished with the documents on succession and arranged marriages, you walk alone along the road back to your chambers.\n\nAs you pass the old pagoda tree where, legend says, a minister of the last dynasty once hanged himself, a cold shiver creeps up your neck—as if something not quite human has fixed its gaze on you.\n\nIn the wind, it almost sounds like someone is softly reciting a verse."
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Whirl around: who’s there?!"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"

  # Scene 2: A Ghost?
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_2_desc: "There’s no one behind you—only a tiny white ghost flitting at the edge of your vision.\n\nJust as confusion rises, you hear the rustle of cloth overhead.\n\n？？？：「Heehee... VIP customer, your sense of danger’s getting rusty~」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Look up at the tree: that voice is..."

  # Scene 3: The Upside-Down Hall Master
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_3_desc: "Hu Tao hangs upside down from a branch like a bat, plum blossom eyes glinting strangely in the night, one hand gripping the squirming little ghost trying to escape.\n\n胡桃：「Yo~！Good evening! The palace is just packed with heavy yin energy tonight, so I came by to do some volunteer cleaning.\n\nThat little ‘chill to the bone’ you got just now—nice wake-up call, right？」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Rub your forehead and sigh: get down from there, honestly."

  # Scene 4: A Game of Wits (Route Lock)
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_4_desc: "She flips neatly to the ground and circles you, eyeing you up like a patient waiting to be diagnosed.\n\n胡桃：「Don’t pull such a long face! In a gloomy old palace like this, if even I started acting serious, the place really would turn into a coffin interior~」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Play along: 「Waaah! A ghoooost!!」 (you stagger back in exaggerated terror)"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Turn it around on her: 「Lurking around playing ghost at midnight—is this how the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor advertises now？」"

  # Scene 5: Doggerel Verse
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Hu Tao doubles over laughing: 「Hahaha! Your Majesty’s acting puts the storytellers to shame！」\n\nA knowing glint flashes in her eyes: 「People who can still joke at a time like this... are usually the ones pushing themselves the hardest. Those who wear masks always make the best actors, you know？」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Hu Tao waggles a finger in mock outrage: 「Misunderstanding! This is market research！」\n\nHer eyes soften with a hint of pity: 「If even jokes have to be framed as ‘tactics,’ that string inside you is wound too tight—it’ll snap someday, you know？」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "When the laughter dies down, she perches on the vermilion railing, legs swinging, and chants toward the moon:\n\n「Walls high and locks shut tight, scrolls piled up like a mountain white.\nWhile living, worked half to death... who pays the bill once you’ve drawn your last breath？」\n胡桃：「Tsk, tsk—so deep, so deep~！」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Give a helpless smile: crude words, but not wrong."

  # Scene 6: A Dialectic on Life and Death
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_6_desc: "Hu Tao tilts her head, expression turning more earnest: 「You’ve got all this to worry about every day, and on top of that you’re fretting over how the chronicles will write you a few hundred years from now... isn’t that exhausting？」\n\nShe reaches out to tap, from a distance, at your furrowed brow.\n\n「Back home, only the ‘clients’ who never figured out how to live before they died end up with their brows stuck like that.\n\nYou haven’t even made it into a coffin yet—so why are you already wearing the dead man’s frown？」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Stay silent."

  # Scene 7: Seen Through (Reversal Lock)
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "Hu Tao sighs and tucks away her grin: 「When you played along with me just now, were you thinking you shouldn’t let the mood get too stiff?\n\nYou’re always managing everyone else’s feelings, always planning exits for them... except yourself.\n\nYou’re scared that if you ever fall, everything will collapse, aren’t you？」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "Hu Tao shakes her head: 「When you were grilling me just now, what you really had in mind was that tomorrow’s morning court can’t be wasted, right?\n\nYou turn everything into tasks and tick-boxes.\n\nIf tomorrow were the end of the world, would you still be there putting little checks on a form？」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Meet her gaze: she’s seen right through you."

  # Scene 8: Plum Blossom
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_8_desc: "She pulls a sprig of red plum blossoms from her sleeve and holds it out.\n\n胡桃：「Why does the plum bloom in the coldest days of winter?\n\nBecause only when all else has withered away does the way life burns shine the brightest.\n\nJust like you, you know。」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Take the branch of plum blossoms."

  # Scene 9: Endings A/B
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Hu Tao presses her hat to her chest, solemn yet gentle, ghostly butterflies seeming to dance behind her.\n\n「If you really can’t let go, then I’ll give you a promise as Hall Master:\n\nGo ahead and burn, conquer, and make mistakes to your heart’s content.\n\nThe ash that’s left, the regrets hiding in the shadows, the aftermath you fear most...\n\nI’ll clean it all up for you.\n\nAs long as I’m here, the rules between life and death won’t fall apart！」"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Thank you... Hall Master."

  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Hu Tao grabs your hand and tugs you toward the depths of the imperial garden, her skirt flaring in the night.\n\n「Lecture time’s over! Treatment time now！\n\nForget the memorials—on a night this pretty, not playing hide-and-seek is a crime against life itself！」\n\n「Hang on tight~ There’s a hidden passage by the old well that leads straight to the imperial kitchens... let’s go steal some snacks！」\n\nHer laughter sparks a long-forgotten sense of youth in your chest."
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Recklessly follow her lead!"
