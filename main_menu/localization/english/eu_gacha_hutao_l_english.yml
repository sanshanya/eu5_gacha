  # === Traits ===
  gacha_hutao_origin_trait: "Wangsheng Funeral Outreach"
  desc_gacha_hutao_origin_trait: "“The people of your country sure seem scared of death, huh? That won’t do—when folks fear it too much, that’s when panic spreads. Birth, age, sickness, death… they’re all just part of the natural order, as normal as breathing. Let me help you promote a healthier view of ‘passing on.’ Once people feel at ease about it, they can live their days in peace.”"

  gacha_hutao_awakened_trait: "Crimson Ghostfire Clears the Way"
  desc_gacha_hutao_awakened_trait: "“You think I’m no good in war? Tsk, don’t underestimate me. Only someone who’s seen more deaths than most knows how to send people off the fastest. Relax—whether enemy or ally, once they fall, the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor will make sure everyone gets a fair spot on the other side.”"

  gacha_hutao_transcended_trait: "Guide of the Ghostly Butterflies"
  desc_gacha_hutao_transcended_trait: "“You’re really putting me on the throne, huh? Hehe, suits me just fine. Under my rule, yin and yang will be in order, and both the living and the dead will rest easy. While alive, you get hustle and bustle; once you go, you get dignity and ceremony. Isn’t that the perfect golden age?”"

  # Constellation Traits
  gacha_hutao_c2_trait: "Border · Requiem"
  desc_gacha_hutao_c2_trait: "“Where yin and yang meet, all things ebb and flow. I’ve set boundary stones at the four corners of this land. The dead sleep beneath the earth, returning as fertile spring soil; the living need not fear the flames of war, and life goes on and on. Listen closely—that’s the song of souls going home, and the pulse of a nation growing strong.”"

  gacha_hutao_c4_trait: "Crimson Bouquet · Butterfly Blaze"
  desc_gacha_hutao_c4_trait: "“If words can’t persuade the wicked, then we’ll let fire do the talking! My butterflies will flit across the battlefield; every blossom of flame is a ticket to the far shore for another enemy. Don’t blink—this is a grand funeral rite named ‘destruction’!”"

  gacha_hutao_c6_trait: "Mistress of the Afterlife · Samsara"
  desc_gacha_hutao_c6_trait: "“From this seat I can see even more partings and reunions. But precisely because of that, life feels all the more precious, doesn’t it? There’s no need to fear the end—I’m the gatekeeper. As long as I’m here, this country’s allotted span of years isn’t over yet. So go on, stir up a storm, Your Majesty!”"

  # === C3 Story Chain: Doggerel in the Back Alleys ===
  gacha_hutao_c3_title: "Doggerel in the Back Alleys"

  # Scene 1: Chill at Your Back
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_1_desc: "After finishing the paperwork on succession and marriage alliances, you walk alone along the path back to your chambers.\n\nAs you pass an old pagoda tree—rumored to have once borne the corpse of a minister hanged in a previous dynasty—a chill crawls up the back of your neck, like the gaze of something not quite human.\n\nIn the wind, it feels as if someone is softly chanting."
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Whip around: who’s there?!"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip this story"

  # Scene 2: A Ghost?
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_2_desc: "Behind you there’s no one—only a little white ghost flickers at the edge of your vision.\n\nJust as confusion rises, you hear the rustle of cloth from above your head.\n\n???: “Heehee… Big client, your sense of danger’s gotten rusty~”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Look up at the tree: that voice…"

  # Scene 3: The Upside-Down Director
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_3_desc: "Hu Tao hangs upside down from a branch like a bat, plum-blossom eyes gleaming mischievously in the night as she pinches the squirming little ghost trying to escape.\n\nHu Tao: “Yo! Good evening! The palace is packed with gloomy energy, so I came for some volunteer deep-cleaning. That little ‘chill straight to your core’ just now—refreshing, right?”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Rub your forehead: “Get down here. This is hardly proper.”"

  # Scene 4: The Game Begins
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_4_desc: "She flips down to the ground and circles around you, looking you up and down like a physician examining a patient.\n\nHu Tao: “Don’t be so stiff! In a deathly serious palace like this, if even I start acting proper, this place will really turn into a coffin interior.”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Play along: “Aaah! A ghoooost!!” (you stagger back dramatically)"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Counter-interrogate: “Putting on a ghost act in the middle of the night—is this how Wangsheng does marketing?”"

  # Scene 5: Alley Doggerel
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Hu Tao doubles over laughing.\n\nHu Tao: “Hahaha! Your Majesty, your acting’s better than a storyteller’s!”\n\nA knowing glint flashes in her eyes.\n\nHu Tao: “Anyone who can still crack jokes like that must be pushing themselves pretty hard, huh? The best actors are always the ones wearing masks.”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Hu Tao wags a finger in mock severity.\n\nHu Tao: “Misunderstanding! This is market research!”\n\nHer gaze grows tinged with pity.\n\nHu Tao: “If even a joke has to be packaged as ‘tactics’ in your eyes… that string inside you is pulled way too tight. It’s gonna snap.”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "After the laughter fades, she hops up to sit on the vermilion railing, swinging her legs as she recites to the moon:\n\n“High walls lock the deep courtyards tight,\nPaperwork piles like mountains high.\nToil like a dog while still alive—\nWho pays the bill when you finally die?”\n\nHu Tao: “Tsk, tsk. Very deep, very deep!”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Give a wry smile: “Crude words, sharp truth.”"

  # Scene 6: A Dialectic on Life and Death
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_6_desc: "Hu Tao tilts her head, a little more serious now.\n\nHu Tao: “You fret over so many things every day, and you’re still worrying about what happens a few hundred years from now…?”\n\nShe reaches out to tap, from afar, at the frown etched into your brow.\n\nHu Tao: “Back home, only the ‘clients’ who didn’t live well enough before they died keep that expression even in their coffins. You haven’t even lain down in yours yet, so why are you already wearing the dead man’s look?”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Say nothing."

  # Scene 7: Seeing Through You
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "Hu Tao sighs and tucks away her usual grin.\n\nHu Tao: “When you were putting on that little act with me just now, you were thinking ‘Can’t let the atmosphere get awkward,’ weren’t you?\n\nYou’re always tending to everyone else’s feelings, always arranging their escape routes—except your own.\n\nYou’re scared that if you fall, everything will collapse with you… right?”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "Hu Tao shakes her head.\n\nHu Tao: “When you were interrogating me just now, you were thinking about how you can’t waste tomorrow morning’s court session, huh?\n\nYou treat everything as tasks, as checkboxes on a form.\n\nIf tomorrow were the end of the world, would you still be there ticking boxes?”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Meet her eyes: she’s seen straight through you."

  # Scene 8: The Plum Blossom
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_8_desc: "She pulls a single red plum blossom from her sleeve and offers it to you.\n\nHu Tao: “Do you know why plum blossoms bloom in the coldest time of year? Because only when everything else has withered away does the sight of life burning bright become the most moving.\n\nJust like you.”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Take the plum blossom."

  # Scene 9: Endings A / B
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Hu Tao presses her hat to her chest, solemn yet gentle, as if ghostly butterflies are dancing in the air behind her.\n\nHu Tao: “Then let me make you a promise: go ahead and burn, conquer, make mistakes.\n\nThe ashes left behind, the regrets hiding in the shadows, the aftercare you worry about the most—I’ll clean all of it up for you.\n\nAs long as I’m here, the rules between life and death won’t fall into chaos.”"
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Thank you… Director."

  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Hu Tao grabs your hand and pulls you deeper into the imperial garden, her skirt swirling.\n\nHu Tao: “Lecture time’s over! With moonlight this pretty, it’d be a waste of life not to play hide-and-seek!”\n\nHu Tao: “Hold on tight! There’s a secret passage by the old dry well that leads straight to the imperial kitchens… let’s go steal some snacks!”\n\nHer laughter sets long-dormant youthful recklessness blazing once more."
  gacha_hutao_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Risk life and limb for fun!"
