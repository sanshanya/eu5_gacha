  # === Traits ===
  gacha_nahida_origin_trait: "Caged Bird of the Sanctuary"
  desc_gacha_nahida_origin_trait: "“I was once locked inside a cage called the Sanctuary of Surasthana, watching the people outside suffer because they lacked knowledge. Your country… also seems to have stalled because new ideas cannot spread. Let me open a window for you. Knowledge should never belong to just a few.”"

  gacha_nahida_awakened_trait: "Interpreter of Maya’s Dream"
  desc_gacha_nahida_awakened_trait: "“So this is war? I’m not very good at fighting, but in my eyes that fortress’s structure looks as simple as a stack of toy blocks. As long as we find the critical ‘node’… there, that’s its weak point. No rivers of blood are needed—just a small, carefully planned collapse.”"

  gacha_nahida_transcended_trait: "Lesser Lord Kusanali"
  desc_gacha_nahida_transcended_trait: "“Governing a nation is like tending a garden. If you let the weeds of bureaucracy grow wild, the flowers will inevitably wither. I’ll help you comb through the tangled roots of this great empire… just don’t expect me to become another ‘false god’ who tries to control people’s hearts.”"

  # Constellation Traits
  gacha_nahida_c2_trait: "A Thousand Roses · Dawn"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c2_trait: "“I’ve linked every corner of this country together. Knowledge is no longer the privilege of scholars alone, but a blessing that falls like sunlight over all the land. Watch—once ignorance is pushed back, thought itself will bloom like a thousand roses. Your people will be the first to greet the dawn.”"

  gacha_nahida_c4_trait: "Skandha Mark · Lockdown"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c4_trait: "“Once you’ve found the structural ‘dead point,’ even the strongest walls are nothing more than sandcastles. I’ve already calculated ten thousand ways for the enemy’s defensive line to collapse. All that’s left… is a gentle push. Look, the siege is over. That is the power of wisdom.”"

  gacha_nahida_c6_trait: "Lord of Wisdom · Buer"
  desc_gacha_nahida_c6_trait: "“Here, I am no longer a god in a cage, nor a piece of history that must be erased. I am Buer, the guide who will lead this great empire toward true omniscience. Let’s break through every research bottleneck together, until the light of this civilization reaches places even the world tree cannot touch.”"

  gacha_nahida_events.1.title: "Buer Nahida — The ‘Backup’ Forgotten by the World"
  gacha_nahida_events.1.desc: "“Nice to meet you. I’m Nahida, the Dendro Archon of Sumeru.\n\n…This is a little strange. According to my memories, this world shouldn’t exist at all. And yet, here you are, and here I am.\n\nMaybe I’ll just treat it as a large-scale ‘dream’ experiment.\n\nI’ll use my wisdom to help you analyze the underlying logic of this world.\n\nIn exchange… would you be my one and only ‘recorder’?”"
  gacha_nahida_events.1.a: "Welcome, God of Wisdom."

  gacha_nahida_events.2.title: "Growth of Wisdom"

  gacha_nahida_events.12.title: "Causal Connections"
  gacha_nahida_events.12.desc: "“Once every enemy is marked with a ‘Skandha Seed,’ their movements are completely within our grasp. Hidden supply lines, cracks in the walls—before the God of Wisdom, nothing can hide. This is… what it means to lay siege with knowledge.”"

  gacha_nahida_events.13.title: "Spare Processing Power"
  gacha_nahida_events.13.desc: "“Even though there’s no Akasha Terminal here, I still keep my habit of processing large amounts of data.

  # === C3 Story Chain: Sunlight Beyond the Greenhouse ===
  gacha_nahida_c3_title: "Sunlight Beyond the Greenhouse"
  
  # Scene 1
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_desc: "Nahida: “...The logic doesn’t hold.”\n\nLate at night in the royal library, Nahida sits on the floor, surrounded by atlases, ledgers, and historical records. With quill and ink, she has turned centuries of wars into a sprawling decision tree.\n\nNahida: “From a purely rational perspective, every previous ruler of Europa made choices that led toward expansion and plunder. Their decision models all strictly followed a greedy algorithm of geopolitics.”\n\nNahida: “But ever since you took over, that model… has collapsed.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Listen quietly."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip story"

  # Scene 2
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_2_desc: "She rises, picks up a decree you just approved, and studies it with eyes that look as though they have already seen through everything.\n\nNahida: “I tried to fit your choices into the old model, but it keeps throwing errors. It’s as if someone has quietly placed a piece on the board that was never supposed to exist.”\n\nNahida: “This will doesn’t belong to Europa, nor to this age. It’s rational and kind, and yet… there’s a detached, overlooking calm to it.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Neither confirm nor deny."

  # Scene 3
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_3_desc: "Nahida points to a carefully pruned bonsai on the windowsill.\n\nNahida: “Your Majesty, in theory this country was supposed to end up like this potted tree.”\n\nNahida: “Its roots confined by the pot, its branches trimmed by the gardener—it was meant to grow into a predetermined shape.”\n\nNahida: “But if a ray of light insists on shining through the glass of the greenhouse at a strange angle…”\n\nNahida: “Then the plant will defy the gardener’s shears and strain with all its might toward that light, growing into something completely different.”\n\nNahida: “Are you… that ray of light?”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Say nothing."

  # Scene 4 (Identity Branch)
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_desc: "Her expression holds no judgment—only pure curiosity and a faint hint of expectation.\n\nIn this greenhouse built from data and decisions, she has keenly sensed your anomaly as a ‘descender’."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "I really do come from outside the greenhouse. I’m here to change the shape of this plant."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "I’ve only done what a sovereign ought to. You’re overthinking it."

  # Scene 5
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Nahida gently presses a hand to her chest and lets out a relieved smile.\n\nNahida: “So my deduction was correct. You are not only that light, but also the ‘new gardener’ holding the shears.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Nahida gently presses a hand to her chest and smiles in quiet relief.\n\nNahida: “Hehe, you’re very good at hiding. But logic can be faked—warmth cannot.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "Nahida: “Even without data from an Akasha Terminal, this feeling is very familiar to me… In another world, I was illuminated by a ray of light just like this.”\n\nNahida: “That light didn’t belong to Teyvat. It came from beyond the sea of stars, and yet it stopped for the sake of one little bird in a cage.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "A caged bird… that was a long time ago."

  # Scene 6
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_6_desc: "Nahida closes her eyes, as if savoring a precious memory.\n\nNahida: “Back then, I thought that if that light ever left, I would fall back into an endless night.”\n\nNahida: “But it turns out the light didn’t disappear—it only changed the way it shines.”\n\nNahida: “You are no longer that golden-haired traveler. You’ve become the will of this country, the mind behind all these decisions…”\n\nNahida: “But this ‘frequency of the soul’ is something I could never mistake.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Reach out: no matter the shape, I’m here."

  # Scene 7 (Relationship Branch)
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_desc: "Nahida extends her hand toward you, palm up—half invitation, half confirmation.\n\nNahida: “If my guess is right, you didn’t come here just to interfere with history out of idle curiosity.”\n\nNahida: “So… what am I to you now?”\n\nNahida: “A convenient external ‘intelligence core’? Or someone you’d want to meet again in every possible world?”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "You’re my external brain. Let’s solve this world’s mysteries together."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_7_opt_b: "You’re the person I’d want to meet again, no matter the world."

  # Scene 8
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_8_desc: "Nahida takes your hand. Tiny green Dendro motes float into the air of the library, blending with the dust motes and starlight.\n\nNahida: “As long as this kind of entanglement between souls remains, I can always locate where ‘I’ am.”\n\nNahida: “This isn’t a foreign land. As long as that light exists… this place can become the new Sanctuary of Surasthana.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "This time, there will be no cage."

  # Scene 9
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Nahida picks up her quill again; her eyes are sharp and confident. Behind her, it’s as if streams of data are flowing through the air.\n\nNahida: “The beauty of history lies not only in schemes and battles, but in the chaotic patterns that emerge from countless individual choices.”\n\nNahida: “I’ve already calculated optimal thresholds for administrative capacity, penalties for overextension, and the weight of diplomatic relations.”\n\nNahida: “Let’s rewrite this timeline’s ‘data’ together. This time, we won’t make any mistakes.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Nahida shows you the sweetest of smiles as the first light of dawn touches the ends of her hair.\n\nNahida: “Here, I’m no longer afraid to close my eyes—because I know that when I open them again, you’ll still be here.”\n\nNahida: “The flower carriage isn’t jolting anymore. No matter which world we go to, no matter what we become…”\n\nNahida: “That ray of light—that first sage who reached out to me—will always be waiting, somewhere deep inside the script.”\n\nShe hooks her little finger toward you, as if sealing a contract that crosses dimensions.\n\nNahida: “Good night… and good morning. My very first sage.”"
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Then let’s begin, Buer."
  gacha_nahida_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "Good morning, Nahida."
