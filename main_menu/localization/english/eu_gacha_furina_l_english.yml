  # === Traits (Traits) ===
  gacha_furina_origin_trait: "Opéra Épiclèse"
  desc_gacha_furina_origin_trait: "“See? Even if I don’t say a word, the moment I stand there, everyone’s eyes turn to me. That is what’s called ‘star power.’ Your country’s been dreary for far too long—it needs a touch of drama to rouse the people. Leave it to me. I’ll teach your citizens how to cheer again.”"

  gacha_furina_awakened_trait: "Afternoon Tea with the Salon"
  desc_gacha_furina_awakened_trait: "“Lord Usher, Lady Chevreuse, and Madame Haverma… They may just be my rather immature imaginary friends, but out at sea, they’re remarkably reliable, you know? Commanding a fleet is just like conducting an orchestra—so long as the tempo is right, even raging waves will dance along to the performance.”"

  gacha_furina_transcended_trait: "Mask of the ‘God of All Waters’"
  desc_gacha_furina_transcended_trait: "“I may no longer be a god, but after playing the role for five hundred years, the posture still remains. Bluffing, diplomatic phrasing, keeping up appearances before great powers… these are what I’m best at. So long as I never lose my nerve, no one will dare belittle this nation.”"

  # Constellation Traits
  gacha_furina_c2_trait: "Cardinal of Oracular Verdicts"
  desc_gacha_furina_c2_trait: "“Look, they’re cheering! What they need is not only bread, but also a spectacle of ‘justice.’ I made a few tiny edits to your legal code—just enough to make it read more like poetry. Now the resistance to reform is much smaller, because everyone wants to see what happens in the next act.”"

  gacha_furina_c4_trait: "Sea of Universal Revelry"
  desc_gacha_furina_c4_trait: "“Right now, the sea is my stage! At this very moment, every spotlight in the world is focused on your fleet! Don’t fear the storm—that’s merely the accompaniment before the climax! Let the enemy make their exit amidst our revelry. That, my dear, is what you call… a show-stopping finale!”"

  gacha_furina_c6_trait: "Universal Jubilation"
  desc_gacha_furina_c6_trait: "“Five hundred years… I once thought that ‘rule’ meant nothing but endless solitude and suffering. But here, watching your back as you walk ahead, I’ve learned that ruling can also be a grand ball that everyone is invited to join. I’m done being a god. From now on, I’m merely the freest… person on this blessed land.”"

  # === Events ===
  gacha_furina_events.1.title: "The Soloist Who Never Takes a Bow · Furina — Curtain Rises Again"
  gacha_furina_events.1.desc: "#ZG At the center of the wishing circle, golden script crawls along the etched lines.\nStacks of verdicts, bound law codes, scraps of finery, and broken masks all dissolve into motes of light, gently swallowed by a clear water bubble rising from the heart of the array.\nWithin the bubble’s shell, where golden sigils and pale-blue ripples intertwine, a young woman sits curled up.\nHer lavish blue-and-white gown cascades in layers like waves; the feather on her hat droops beside her brow.\nHer lashes are lowered, and a faint, ambiguous smile rests on her lips.\nWith a soft pop, the bubble’s wall shatters; droplets scatter, then are gathered once more by the glow of the circle.#!\nThe girl opens one eye, landing lightly at the circle’s center. Her skirt and the mist flare up together, like a curtain slowly descending at center stage."
  gacha_furina_events.1.a: "Step forward to take a closer look."

  gacha_furina_events.10.title: "The Soloist Who Never Takes a Bow · Furina — Just… Furina"
  gacha_furina_events.10.desc: "“Oh my? So this is the legendary ‘stage of another world,’ is it?”\n“I am Furina de Fontaine. Former… oh, never mind, those old titles don’t matter anymore.”\n“I’ve skimmed through your ‘script’ as well. Tsk, tsk—laws piled like mountains, disputes surging like the tide, dull, dreary, utterly devoid of artistry! And the gallery is packed with people just waiting for a farce.”\n“Since the contract is sealed, I shall *reluctantly* accept the position of ‘chief artistic advisor.’ I will bring both order and delight back to this land.”\n“Well then, the stage is set, and the spotlight ought to be shining—allow me to personally direct this nation’s ‘third act’!”\n#ZG She opens the compact she carries at her side, checks her smile in the mirror until it’s perfect, then extends a hand toward you.#!\n“Why are you just standing there? Where is the afternoon tea and cake prepared for your director?”"
  gacha_furina_events.10.a: "Welcome to the stage, Lady Furina."

  gacha_furina_events.2.title: "Climax of the Play"
  gacha_furina_events.2.desc: "Furina’s power has grown. She chuckles softly, saying it feels as if the plot has moved into its next act.\n\n“See? The story is only just beginning!”"
  gacha_furina_events.2.a: "On with the show!"

  gacha_furina_events.4.title: "In a Mortal’s Body"
  gacha_furina_events.4.desc: "“I am Furina.\n\nDid you know? For the past five hundred years, the thing I feared most each morning upon waking… was looking in the mirror.\n\nThe person in the mirror was flawless. She was a god, a faith, the very pillar that held up all of Fontaine.\n\nThe one thing she wasn’t… was ‘me.’\n\nI played that role, dancing alone under the spotlight, with blades beneath my feet and the flood of prophecy before my eyes.\n\nI thought that long, lonely monologue would go on until my death, and no one would ever applaud.\n\nBut then, you found me.\n\nYou brought me to this world without prophecies and without curses.\n\nIn the script you gave me, there is no sacrifice, no tragedy—only unfinished cake and the question of where to go tomorrow.\n\nYou’ve shown me that I don’t need to play a god. Even as the imperfect Furina,\n\nI still have the right to stand by your side and help govern this nation.\n\nThank you, my… first and foremost audience member.\n\nWith the play at this point, I can no longer tell where the stage ends and reality begins.\n\nBut I don’t care.\n\nSo long as you are there to applaud for me, I’m willing to dance this dance for you until the very end of time.”"
  gacha_furina_events.4.a: "Now *this* is the true Furina!"

  gacha_furina_events.11.title: "Faith and Law"
  gacha_furina_events.11.desc: "“Look, they’re cheering! What they need is not only bread, but also a performance of ‘justice.’ I made a few subtle edits to your legal clauses to make them read more like poetry. Now reform meets less resistance—because everyone wants to see what happens in the next act.”"
  gacha_furina_events.11.a: "The stage for justice is ready."

  gacha_furina_events.12.title: "Symphony of the Tides"
  gacha_furina_events.12.desc: "“Right now, the sea is like my stage! At this moment, every light in the world is focused on your fleet! Do not fear the storm—that’s just the accompaniment before the climax! Let the enemy make their exit amidst our revelry. That is what you call… the finale!”"
  gacha_furina_events.12.a: "Let the ocean cheer for us!"

  gacha_furina_events.13.title: "New Faces in the Troupe"
  gacha_furina_events.13.desc: "“Your court is far too quiet. I’ve pulled a few interesting scripts from Fontaine—well, from my memories of it. Add another advisor’s seat, won’t you? After all, how can a splendid opera have only a lead and no supporting cast? …Of course, *you* are the lead.”"
  gacha_furina_events.13.a: "Add another seat."

  gacha_furina_events.14.title: "All Nations in Attendance"
  gacha_furina_events.14.desc: "“More and more nations are sending their envoys… Hmph, seems that even in another world, Lady Furina’s charm cannot be stopped. Go on, build more friendships. After all, the more guests you have at your curtain call, the better, don’t you think?”"
  gacha_furina_events.14.a: "Let the world come to court."

  # === C3 Affection Event: An Encore With No Audience ===
  gacha_furina_c3_title: "Encore With No Audience"

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_1_desc: "To celebrate the signing of a diplomatic alliance, the court held a grand banquet. Now the clamor has faded; the guests have all taken their leave.\n\nPassing by the empty main stage, you hear the faint clink of silver on porcelain, mingled with a few stifled sighs.\n\nThe curtain hangs low, half the chandeliers are out, and only moonlight spills through the high windows onto the stage, leaving it vast and lonely."
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Follow the sound."
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip this story"

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_2_desc: "Just beyond the reach of the spotlights, Furina has kicked off her heels and sits on the steps wrapped in a thin shawl.\n\nShe’s holding a slice of cake, already half-eaten, nibbling in small bites as she mutters to herself, reviewing today’s ‘performance.’\n\nFurina: “...Haa. Today’s speech… shouldn’t have had any flaws, right? When that ambassador from the neighboring country was staring at me, I almost thought he’d noticed something…”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Walk closer to the stage."

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_3_desc: "Your footsteps echo through the theater, and she spins around like a startled cat.\n\nHer fork clatters against the plate as she forces her chin up, trying to put on airs—there’s still cream at the corner of her mouth.\n\nFurina: “Who’s there?! …Ah, Y–Your Majesty?! Ahem! I was merely… passing judgment on this cake’s flavor!”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Stop where you are: passing judgment on a cake?"

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_4_desc: "Her defenses are as thin as paper; her cheeks flush, yet she still tries to look ‘composed.’ You decide how to respond."
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Play along: “And what sentence does the High Judge pass on this cake’s crimes?”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Gently unmask her: “There’s no audience here, Furina. You don’t need to justify a midnight snack.”"

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "She freezes for a moment, then lets out a small snort of laughter, pointing her fork at the cake as her usual haughty confidence returns.\n\nFurina: “Hmph… you do know your role. This court hereby declares—this cake is *far* too sweet, tempting me into eating at this hour. Its crimes are grave! It must be sentenced to immediate ‘execution’—that is, to be eaten at once!”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Her movements halt entirely; the fork trembles slightly in the air. Slowly, she lets the façade drop and murmurs under her breath.\n\nFurina: “...Must you be that blunt? Sometimes, acting is the only way to keep myself from falling apart…”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "She looks down at the half-slice of cake and sighs softly.\n\nFurina: “At the celebration banquet just now, I didn’t eat a single bite. I was afraid that if I relaxed for even a moment, I’d slip up… that they’d notice that right now, I’m actually… nothing at all.”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Sit down beside her: you’ve worked hard."

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_6_desc: "She turns her head to look at you, her eyes dim.\n\nFurina: “In this world, there’s no prophecy anymore, and no role I *must* play.”\nFurina: “But the moment the lights come on, I still instinctively put on the mask.”\n\nShe lifts her gaze; in her violet eyes flicker the traces of five centuries of loneliness.\n\nFurina: “If I don’t play the great star… if I’m just Furina, who steals food, gets stage fright, and does foolish things… would you still need me?”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Meet her eyes."

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_7_desc: "After so long spent acting, she’s forgotten how to simply be herself. She fears that once the makeup is gone, she’ll lose all love and attention.\n\nAs her one and only ‘premier audience member,’ you reach out and give your answer."
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Offer an invitation: “Then let this be a brand-new play that never ends—and I’ll be your lead co-star.”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_7_opt_b: "Give affirmation: “I don’t need a fake god. I just need the you who’s here eating cake with me.”"

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_8_desc: "She’s stunned at first, then tears of relief glimmer at the corners of her eyes as a clear, girlish laugh escapes her.\n\nFurina: “...Lines like that are even more unfair than the ones in opera.”\nShe splits the ‘heinous’ cake in two and holds half of it up to your lips."
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "Take a bite: it tastes very sweet."

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_9_desc_a: "Furina rises to her feet and offers you a hand, inviting you to dance with her upon the empty stage.\n\nFurina: “Very well! Since you’ve invited me so earnestly, I, Furina, shall *reluctantly* continue to shine!”\nFurina: “This time, we’ll write the script together. No tragedies, no sacrifices—only cheers and applause!”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_9_opt_a: "Let the curtain rise."

  gacha_furina_c3_scene_9_desc_b: "Furina leans against your shoulder, eyes closed in contentment, quietly repeating: “Just being Furina… is enough?”\n\nFurina: “I don’t want to act anymore. I don’t want to rehearse tomorrow’s expressions. I just want to stay like this and think about nothing at all.”\nFurina: “You’re not allowed to go back on this, you know… my premier audience.”"
  gacha_furina_c3_scene_9_opt_b: "I’ll never go back on it."
