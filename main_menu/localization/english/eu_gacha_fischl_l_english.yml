  gacha_fischl_events.1.desc: "#ZG At the center of the wishing circle, golden script traces along the etched lines.\nUnfurled star charts, a black-covered storybook crammed with handwritten notes, divination lots, and quills rise from the floor together, swirling above the array as if drawn by an unseen gravity, gathering into a violet meteor shower at the circle’s heart.\nFrom the carved lines, a bubble of deep, black-violet light rises—like a tiny black hole—and a slender figure curls within.#!\nPale-gold hair and ribbons drift lightly in the watery glow, while a black-and-violet dress spreads out like a blossom of night. Her eyes are closed beneath an eyepatch, the corners of her lips curved in a faintly smug smile.#ZG \nAt her feet, a dark violet orb hangs quietly in the air.\nWith a soft crack, the bubble’s shell splinters; purple light scatters like feathers on the wind.#!"

  gacha_fischl_events.10.desc: "#ZG The girl opens her eyes, spreads her arms, and descends into the circle as if borne by the wind; her skirt and streaks of violet lightning flare up together. The orb becomes a night raven that takes wing, tracing a pitch-black arc behind her.#!\n\"Heh… Guided by the threads of fate, drawn hither by the wishes of myriad realms, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, Fischl, hath at last descended.\"\n\"Rejoice! This Prinzessin hath crossed the narrow gulf between three thousand worlds, heeding fate’s 'summons' to appear upon this desolate plane!\"\n\"I am the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort—sole sovereign of the Evernight Realm!\"\nShe places one hand on her hip; beneath the eyepatch, a faint crimson glint seems to flash in her right eye.\n\"This dominion… Hm. It is sufficiently vast. I shall, albeit reluctantly, permit it to serve as the Evernight Realm’s palace in the mortal world. Since thou hast offered up the tribute, this Prinzessin shall in turn bestow upon thee hallowed glory!\"\n#ZG She suddenly points straight at you, violet lightning crackling at her fingertip.#!\nFischl: \"Rejoice, o ally of this world! In this age rife with falsehood and betrayal, only the 'Eye of Judgment' of the Prinzessin may pierce the veil of lies!\"\n#ZG The night raven settles upon her shoulder and gives you a polite bow.\nOz: \"An honor to make your acquaintance. I am Ozvaldo von Hrafnavines. As you can see, my lady means to say—she has accepted your offer of an advisory position.\"\nOz: \"My lady’s words may be interpreted thus: she is delighted to have come to your country. Though she is unfamiliar with this land, she will do her utmost to assist you in matters of espionage and war. We ask for your kind cooperation.\"#!\nFischl: \"Oz! The words of this Prinzessin require no translation!\"\n#ZG Oz: \"Yes, yes, my lady.

Only Oz stood by my side.\n\nI thought it was a dream that would never descend into reality.\n\nUntil the day you summoned me here.\n\nYou did not laugh at my words. Instead, you placed the scepter that commands legions into my hand.\n\nYou did not question my bloodline. Instead, you made this vast empire my true garden.\n\nBehold—these unbroken chains of fortresses, these nations brought to heel, this sky ablaze with artillery and glory…\n\nAre these not the sights that graced the final chapter of *Flowers for Princess Fischl*?\n\nThank you.\n\nIt was you who turned my 'lies' into an unassailable 'reality.'\n\nFrom this day forth, I shall guard your reality in turn.\n\nBy the name of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung—no, by the name of Fischl herself—I swear:\n\nThis world is our pure land, and you… are my one and only co-ruler.\""

  # Scene 1: A Shadow in the Rain
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_1_desc: "The storm drums upon the palace dome, each impact a dull, rolling boom.\n\nAt the entrance to the colonnade, a thoroughly soaked night raven—Oz—perches on a stone pillar, feathers in disarray.\n\nOz: \"…Ah, it is you. If you do not wish tomorrow’s diplomatic address to be delivered as a string of sneezes… I would recommend that you go and talk some sense into her.\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_1_opt_a: "Look toward the depths of the colonnade."
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_1_opt_skip: "Skip this story"

  # Scene 2: A Ritual That Failed
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_2_desc: "At the end of the colonnade, Fischl stands at the very edge of the rain, hands raised high toward the sky. Water streams down her fingertips; her dress is utterly soaked.\n\nFischl: \"—By the darkness of this world, I sever the tears beyond the veil! Begone, o rampaging spirits of the elements!\"\n\nKra-BOOM—the thunder drowns her words, and the downpour only grows heavier. She stubbornly keeps her arms aloft, her posture slowly warping in the cold wind."
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_2_opt_a: "Step closer: the rain has not stopped."

  # Scene 3: A bedraggled Prinzessin
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_3_desc: "Your footsteps alert her. She whirls around; wet bangs cling to her forehead, and her eyepatch sits slightly askew.\n\nFischl straightens her back and crosses her arms, trying to hide the soaked collar at her throat.\n\nFischl: \"Who goes there?! …Hmph, so it is thou, ally of this world. Hast thou come to bear witness to the 'rite of judgment' of the Prinzessin? Stand back—achoo!!\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_3_opt_a: "Stop where you are: this is the 'rite of judgment'?"

  # Scene 4: Choice (Route Lock)
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_4_desc: "Whatever 'ritual' this was, it has clearly failed. Before you stands nothing more than a drenched, shivering girl. You decide what to do."
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_4_opt_a: "Play along: \"The causal flow has been obstructed. Shall I lend you my 'mana'?\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_4_opt_b: "Open an umbrella: \"This may prove more effective than magic.\""

  # Scene 5: Shaken (Branch Text)
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_5_desc_a: "Fischl’s eyes go wide. \"…Mana? Thou canst comprehend this lofty formula?\"\n\nOz: \"My lady, it seems our ally has no intention of mocking your failure. Now that we have external mana support, perhaps we could… make a strategic retreat?\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_5_desc_b: "Fischl huffs: \"Hmph… a primitive rain-warding tool. How could the Prinzessin ever require such a…\" Yet her body very honestly shuffles a step closer to the umbrella.\n\nOz: \"My lady, if not for yourself, then for my sake—please accept the umbrella.\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_5_desc_common: "Fischl scolds Oz, but her voice is hoarse.\n\n\"…‘Tis not that the rite hath failed. It is merely that… this sky knows me not. I can no longer see the threads of fate… I do not know when this rain will end.\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_5_opt_a: "Watch her closely: she is lost."

  # Scene 6: A New Pact (Route Options)
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_6_desc: "In the downpour, her so-called 'stars' and 'causality' are silent. What she needs now is a reason to remain."
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_6_opt_a: "Grant new meaning: \"If the constellations have changed, then we rewrite them. This shall be your new Evernight Realm.\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_6_opt_b: "Call her true name: \"The rain will stop, Amy. Until then, I’ll be the one holding the umbrella.\""

  # Scene 7: Her Answer
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_7_desc_a: "Fischl snaps her head up; a fever-bright light sparks to life in her eyes, excitement driving the chill away now that she’s been acknowledged.\n\nOz folds his wings and quietly withdraws into the shadows."
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_7_desc_b: "At the sound of her real name, she jolts; a flush races across her cheeks, leaving her utterly flustered.\n\nOz silently steps back, leaving the two of you alone."
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_7_opt_a: "Hold out your hand: come on."

  # Scene 8: Endings A / B
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_8_desc_a: "Fischl straightens her eyepatch, plants one hand on her hip, and clasps your hand with the other, her sheer presence lighting up the stormy night.\n\n\"Very well! Since thou art willing to offer up this dominion, this Prinzessin shall bestow upon thee the title of 'Hallowed King'!\"\nOz: \"As you command, my lady. But we should change into dry clothes first, or your Hallowed King will catch a cold.\"\nFischl: \"S–So noisy! …And… thank you, for believing in me.\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_8_opt_a: "As you wish, Your Highness."

  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_8_desc_b: "She does not rebuke the name. Instead, she lowers her head and grips the hem of your coat—the handle of your umbrella—her face red to the tips of her ears.\n\n\"…Thou shalt not bandy that name about so lightly! It is…\"\nOz: \"My lady means to say: she is very happy. And also, that she would like to go back inside and have something warm to eat.\"\nFischl: \"Oz!!!\""
  gacha_fischl_c3_scene_8_opt_b: "Come on. Let’s go home."
